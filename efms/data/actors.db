style=\"float:right;margin:5px;border:0px\" src=\"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Classes/scout_01.webp\" />\n<p>Rough and grizzled looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the quarry he knows is planning a raid on a nearby settlement. Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>\n<p>After tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile's explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank. Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe, firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick armor.</p>\n<p>Glancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.</p>\n<p>Scouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.</p>\n<h2>Deadly Hunters</h2>\n<p>Warriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>\n<p>Scouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A scout's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the civilization.</p>\n<h2>Independent Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Though a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout's true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>\n<p>As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. </p>\n<p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?</p>\n<p>What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the bounty hunter background.</p>"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Scout Techniques</h1>\n<p>Scouts tend to share knowledge amongst them selves, focusing on specific techniques and honing them to perfection.

Twi'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, twi'leks rarely refuse food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi'lek society also considers obesity as a sign of influence and success.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female twi'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth's harsh environment. A number of twi'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi'leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Twi'lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Ecrizsati, Gaj'mogos, Ukelweko</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Arag'mure, Oanicfuba, Unaecripi</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","traits":{"value":"<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.0TBxysJocgzEFcnZ]{Ability Score Increase}.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.pNmVIvLTtM69owqX]{Age}.</strong></em> Twi'leks reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.V3Khpa3e3MHbMXjY]{Alignment}.</strong></em> Twi'leks harsh upbringing cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.VlJX0Okh4YtRYzEg]{Size}.</strong></em> Twi'leks stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and weigh up to 200 lbs.

They can come from any world or region in the galaxy, with origins from the lowliest scoundrel to the once social elite.</p>\n<h2>Evading Danger</h2>\n<p>Operatives have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous operatives are also saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. No matter what their immediate concerns may be, survival is the name of the game.</p>\n<h2>Outside the Law</h2>\n<p>Operatives don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.</p>\n<p>While creating your operative character, consider how you first started on your path. Maybe you were raised on the street and fell into the criminal element as a means of survival. You could be a simple trader who decided to strike against the Sith Empire when it encroached on your business. What would you say is your greatest skill set? What is your core, the truest essence about yourself that keeps you focused? Why would society treat you as a criminal, yet your allies hold you as a loyal companion?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make an operative quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence or Charisma. Second, choose the gambler background.</p>"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Operative Practices</h1>\n<p>Operatives share, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes, though their practices differ.

They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as \"humanoids\" because of their structural resemblance to humans.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer. There exist many planetary groups of humans with their own cultures, such as the Alderaanians or the Pamarthens. Humans are the most populous species in the Galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Humans are the most populace species in the Galaxy, and thus their names vary drastically based on the planet or culture with whom they reside.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Koth, Liorz, Satapak, Tin, Vuc</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Dhetia, Jhilk, Risha, Thinnih, Tonu</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Jauli, Kudi, Melmi, Windu, Wobec</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","traits":{"value":"<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.t206rRK6FVoxzA7M]{Ability Score Increase}.</strong></em> One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

Gamorr's technological level was equivalent to the low-tech periods which Human civilizations had experienced circa 25,000 BBY. The Gamorreans colonized the planet Pzob in the K749 system, and were the majority sentient species on Lanthrym in the Elrood sector. Their vessels provided only essential amenities, in addition to shields and weaponry. Gamorreans were typically green-skinned, with a large and powerful physique; they had a well-deserved reputation as fierce warriors, prized much more for their strength and personal combat prowess than for their wits. They were organized into clans headed by a Council of Matrons. In Gamorrean society, sows (females) performed all the productive work...while the boars (males) concentrated on martial training and waging war. They spoke Gamorrese (also called Gamorrean). One of their favorite weapons was a traditional war axe called an arg'garok, which was designed specifically for beings with extraordinary strength as well as a low center of gravity. (They could, however, point and shoot if someone shoved a blaster into their hands.)</p><p>The Galactic Registry entry for Gamorreans on Pzob was 011-733-800-022.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Biology and appearance</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"Skinny v'lch. Not find husband, all skinny. Morrts can't live on skinny. Feed you. Make you Gweek. Good husband; two tuskers; nine morrts.\"</i></p><p>- Captain Ugmush suggests making Callista Ming into a proper Gamorrean sow</p></blockquote><p>Gamorrean males averaged about 1.8 meters in height and could weigh more than 100 kilograms. They had thick snouts, close set eyes, tusks, and two small horns on their heads. Their average body temperature was 40.56 °C (105 °F) and their verbal tones ranged from 50 to 13,000 hertz.</p><p>Although a typical Gamorrean was squat, green, and heavily built not all shared these characteristics. Most Gamorreans had a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration did vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation were possible. Boars tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The Gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.<br /></p><p>Not all Gamorreans were heavy and squat. Although this was the most common and generally the desirable appearance in Gamorrean society some individuals were comparatively lean and tall. Greel, co-owner of the The Broken Tusk on Reuss VIII, was quite undersized compared to his brother Gorge who represented a more conventional Gamorrean appearance.</p><p>They were largely viewed as mindless, intellectually inferior brutes by the wider galactic community. This perception may have been partly due to their physiology, which made it nearly impossible for them to speak Galactic Basic. Their vocal apparatus made it impossible for them to speak clearly in any language other than their native language.<br /></p><p>Gamorreans were typically covered by a number of parasitic bloodsuckers native to Gamorr called morrts. They showed great affection for the creatures and considered them adorable pets. The number of morrts that a Gamorrean hosted was related to their status within a clan. A clan Warlord or Matron could have up to 20 of these parasites feeding on them.<br /></p><p>The Gamorrean diet mainly consisted of fungus that grew plentifully on their homeworld. A species of mobile mushrooms called Snoruuk was one of the most widely eaten varieties along with Fug. They drank an alcoholic beverage called Potwa beer.</p><p>Newly born Gamorreans were called \"feeders\" until they were weaned. Once weaned the younglings were called \"shoats\" until the age of 3 when they began gender specific training. Gamorrean childhood ended after about 6 years from which point they were considered young adults. When they reached the age of 13 they were considered mature adults and the boars would go to war. Biologically they were capable of living beyond the age of 45 but the violent nature of their existence meant that very few boars reached that age.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Society and culture</h3><p><b>Clan Society</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"All this—gweek. Husbands and tuskers and fields and children—gweek. Sometimes … I want gweek. Gweek for me. More so in slushtime, in the cold and the dark.\"</i></p><p>- Kufbrug</p></blockquote><p>Gamorreans were organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, a head sow who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars were solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing weapons and running businesses.</p><p><u>Gamorrean sows</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Stupid, Aurra! Should have checked for that storm! Making mistakes like some Gamorrean sow!\"</i></p><p>- Aurra Sing talking to herself on Tatooine 32 BBY</p></blockquote><p>Females within a clan were all related to each other and could trace their lineage back to a common matriarch. Boars, however, were exchanged between clans at an early age and some would change their allegiance during their adult lives. Clans ranged in size from a few dozen to over a hundred but typically a clan constituted about 20 sows, fifty boars and the young. The young were mostly born in the spring (\"slushtime\") and the litters typically ranged between three and nine. The male to female ratio was about ten-to-one with females only being born about every second litter. Despite this, a high fatality rate among boars, due to their violent lives, resulted in a predominance of older females.</p><p>Clans owned and controlled areas of land and were always interested in acquiring more. Land was gained by either colonizing unclaimed areas or more commonly taking land from rival clans. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr was scarce several clans often laid claim to the same piece of land, and they spent their time fighting over possession. A female typically had up to a dozen husbands during their lifetime since a boar's lifespan was limited by his violent lifestyle.</p><p>Sows did all the useful work within Gamorrean society and they owned and leased all property. They were capable of being as rough as the males and they actively encouraged boars to engage in bloody act of violence to demonstrate their virility. Daughters inherited their mother's land evenly and therefore over generations these holdings diminished in size. A matron consolidating land was a critical reason for the ongoing wars between clans.</p><p>Clan matrons were a select group of sows with the greatest of land who constituted the clan council of matrons. They usually had a number of clan Tusker boars in admiration of their beauty and status. A matron could often be distinguished from a lesser clan sow by the presence of a small number of bodyguards and the relatively large number of morrts that they hosted. The council of matrons was led by a head sow who were the richest and most powerful of the clan matrons.</p><p>Sows were responsible for all trading with non-Gamorreans. They were typically interested in obtaining weapons and food supplies with long lives. They would pay for such goods with gold or other precious metals if they had any or by boar mercenary contract.</p><p><u>Gamorrean boars</u></p><p>There were four classes of male boars within Gamorrean society: Warlords, Clan boars, Tuskers and Veterans. Warlords were the most socially and physically powerful boars in a clan and held their position by way of their marriage to a clan matron. The greatest of the warlords was selected by the head sow for his combat prowess and past successes. He was absolute ruler in all matter of war and general of the clan armies. The lesser warlord served as clan captains. A typical warlord could host up to twenty morrts and they were known to bestow them on other warriors for acts of heroism. Warlords almost always came from the ranks of the household boars (otherwise known as Tuskers).</p><p>Clan boars were males married to clan sows (not matrons) and they made up the core of the clan-guard and the clan army. They were important individuals because the income provided by their wives enabled them to afford good weapons and armor. Their relatively high status (below warlords) was indicated by the 10 or so morrts that lived on their bodies. They could generally not attain the position of warlord unless their wife died and they married a matron or she inherited a matronage, both rare events in Gamorrean society.</p><p>Tuskers or household boars were unmarried males who were pledged to a clan. They formed the bulk of the clan armies and generally lived off the plunder of military campaigns. While a tusker was customarily poor they could hope to gain the attention of a sow or perhaps even a clan matron and therefore enter the ranks of the Clan boars or Warlords. They typically hosted about half a dozen morrts but a successful tusker could amass a much larger trove. They would often give a clan matron their morrts as tribute. Tuskers were not totally loyal and would occasionally change their allegiance to another clan particularly if the clan matron was looking to increase the size of her clan.</p><p>The fourth basic variety of boars in Gamorrean society was the Veteran. They were retired from campaign due to old age or more commonly from a maiming or injury. A veteran could often be identified by the lack of a body part and the presence of about twelve or so morrts. They were typically very tough, experienced boars who were well respected within their clan. They were responsible for the training of the young boars before they first marched off to war and were trusted advisors to clan Warlords. They also often commanded the clan-guard.</p><p>Gamorrean youths often kept gelatinous slimes from the planet Saclas as pets.</p><p><u>Clan fortresses</u></p><p>Gamorrean clans constructed fortresses that varied in size dramatically. They all tended to follow the basic design. The simplest fortresses consisted of a stockade surrounded by a small village of huts and long houses. The clan-guard controlled the boundary of the fortress and kept unwanted visitors away. They domesticated dangerous predators called Watch-beasts to help protect these strongholds. Access to the settlement was through a gate and at the center of the village was typically the clan-house. This was a well constructed, heavily fortified building where the matrons and warlords resided. A small fortress would be inhabited by about 10 sows and 20 boars.</p><p>An average fortress consisted of a village with a stockade that could be surrounded by a moat or other boundary defense. An internal sub-fortress was usually built around the village on a built-up or naturally occurring mount.</p><p>The sub-fortress was a well-built construction that was sometimes built of stone and it was well guarded. In its function, the sub-fortress was a large version of the clan-house. An average Gamorrean village of this size would typically be inhabited by between 30 and 50 sow and as many as 100 boars. Immediately inside the main gate of the village was located a common area. This was a place where markets were held and it represented a safe area for other clan members. It was a serious crime to violate the strict no fighting rules in this area.</p><p>Some of the most powerful and prestigious Gamorrean clans had larger fortresses that were effectively townships. The town was surrounded by an outer wall fortifications and a broad moat. It was often also divided internally by walls to reduce the impact of an enemy that advanced passed the main gate. There were several clan-houses in the internal structure and a sub-fortress that acted as a final refuge against an advancing army. Only about a dozen townships of this size existed on Gamorr and was populated by as many as 100 sows and 300 boars.</p><p>Several of these larger fortresses have constructed a foreigners' quarter within their boundaries where other clans could deal with each other in safety. Like the common area of smaller settlements there was a strict prohibition of combat in this area. Non-Gamorreans were often found trading in these areas. Most towns maintained a large landing field outside of their boundaries.</p><p>Some of the larger clan-towns formed sub-clans that still considered themselves part of the parent clan although local rivalries between sub-clans did develop. It was debated among Xenosociologists whether the development of these large clan-towns marked a societal change within the Gamorrean clan structure or whether these clan-towns would eventually collapse under population and social pressure.</p><ul><li>Bolgoink clan (Gamorr)<br /></li><li>Bk'trugh clan</li><li>Gakfedd clan (Pzob)</li><li>Glonnk clan (Gamorr)</li><li>Groogrun clan (Gamorr)</li><li>Jugsmuk clan (Gamorr)</li><li>Klagg clan (Pzob)</li><li>Norgk clan (Gamorr)</li><li>Rogak clan (Gamorr)</li></ul><p>Some clans formed small professional mercenary bands that move around selling their combat services to the higher bidder. Although it was not exceptional for fashionable clans to occasionally fight for another clan for pay, these mercenary clans did it professionally. They were, however, not totally driven by greed and the warlords of these clans still adhered to the tradition of fighting a blood-battle to complete a deal. Since these clans would go somewhere to carry out a contract they constituted a significant quantification of Gamorrean mercenaries in the galaxy.</p><p>The warring clans of Gamorr never united under the banner of one planetary government and therefore the Gamorreans did not have representation in the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.<br /></p><p>Although Gamorreans were not known for their sensitive nature they were especially demonstrative when it came to their morrts and were particularly loving toward their children and mates. Signs of affection included a tackling hug and a punch on the snout. Indeed, knocking a mate unconscious was considered a prelude to mating, although the initiator had to make sure they had smelling salts at hand if copulation was the intention.<br /></p><p><b>Calendar</b><br /></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Winter is when the boars can't get out and fight one another either, so they get all cozy and pleasant—they really do—and write songs and poems to their sows. Or, they hire me to write songs and poems.\"</i></p><p>- Sebastin Onyx</p></blockquote><p>The activities of the Gamorrean clans on Gamorr were dominated by the seasons. Spring was called slushtime because of the melting of the winter snow and the abundance of rain and resultant perpetual mud. The wet conditions of early slushtime resulted in plentiful harvests of short-term fungi and provided a start for the longer growing moulds. During this period the veteran boars trained the younglings in combat and the unattached tusker boars roamed the land looking for adventure and opportunities. Early slushtime on Gamorr was a depressing time, the constant rain and dark gray skies often resulted in many Gamorreans feeling grumpy and miserable. Since Gamorreans idealized emotions of strength and ferocity it was not a polite subject to discuss their emotional degeneration in this regard. Most sows gave birth at this time which was about a gestation period from the return of the boars from campaigning in autumn. Mid-slushtime was also traditionally the time for marriage and for negotiating and finalizing Clan alliances and mercenary contracts. It was also the time when young boars were exchanged for fostering and the clan matrons readied their warriors for war in the summer. Toward the end of this season clans tuskers tended to initiate raids against rival clans in order to prove their boarness.</p><p>The summer season was called Wartime and initiated a period of military campaigning, often in retaliation for the raids in late-slushtime. The boars, unmarried sows (sometimes derogatorily called \"v'lch\") and young boars in training marched off to war. They left behind the matrons, married sows, elders and a small guard of boars to defend the settlements and fortresses. The military strategy of Gamorrean warfare was quite basic and involved attacking, plundering and the occupation of land. In early-wartime the clans participated in a number of small scale battles during which time each side probed the strength of the opposition for weaknesses. By the middle of the campaigning season the Gamorrean warriors had settled into the business of besieging opponents fortresses and as the temperature increase toward late-summer grand battles were fought as forces attempted to break from a besieged position.</p><p>By the end of the summer period the clans had spent the majority of their strength. There were a few late skirmishes in autumn (Croptime) as the clans made their way back to their homes in triumph or otherwise and by mid-croptime they had settled in for the winter. During this period the sows and drafted tuskers harvested the crops and autumn fairs occurred as newly wealthy clans traded plundered goods and crops. The fairs also operated as a forum for the forming of new clan alliances. Also during this season widowed sows advertised their availability and married, tales of heroic battles were told, wounded boars ceremoniously join the ranks of the veterans and the clans feasted for the last time before the coming of winter.</p><p>Winter was called Coldtime and was a period of freezing temperatures and fierce storms on Gamorr. Clans that were too depleted during the summer campaigning season would often find themselves starving and this sometimes resulted in sporadic winter raids. In the more successful and affluent clans life was more comfortable. Boars became docile and romantic, courting their wives as young tusker males did. This behavior by the boars continued into early spring when the first seasons flowers were picked and presented as gifts to the sows. The unmarried tuskers spent the winter worshiping a matron from a distance, planning for the next seasons combat and playing table games. During the winter and early slushtime some skilled Gamorreans would ride sleds pulled by semi-domesticated Dwoobs as a method for transporting goods. They were generally only used by skilled sled drivers and most used simple wheel barrows to transport goods.</p><p><b>Beliefs</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"It is true also, V'Ich Muh, that Lady Gundruk, and Lugh, and others of the household have heard the spirit of Vrokk moving about at night in the room in which he died. Spirits only walk if murder was done.\"</i></p><p>- A scholar sow explains Gamorrean beliefs to Callista Ming.</p></blockquote><p>Gamorreans were Animistic and believed that everything such as natural features, animals, sites of past battles and people had an enduring spirit that could affect the physical worlds. The superstitious beliefs of the Gamorreans, however, decreased over the last hundred years or so before the Battle of Yavin. Although they believed that everything had a lingering spirit they were generally only concerned with powerful spirits that could pose a threat.</p><p>Famous long-dead heroes, giant trees, large fungi, the spirits of murdered individuals and ancient fortresses are an example of things that Gamorreans believed could help or hinder the living. The association with how these spirits affected the physical world was based on the nature of the source in Gamorreans lives. For example tree and mountain spirit were generally considered good because the source, with which they reside, provides wood and stone for building. This, however, did not mean that they believed that they were totally benign since trees would drop branches on individual and mountains would shed landslides onto unsuspecting Gamorreans.</p><p>The spirits of the sea and forest were considered incomprehensible. Sometimes they would let a traveler past and other times they would hinder their progress. Forests were viewed as mischievous, they would change the path and on occasion swallow an entire fellowship whole. Gamorreans didn't like the oceans as they saw them as incredibly unpredictable. If treated correctly they thought that the spirits would send favorable wind and if angered would unleash a ferocious storm. Even if the spirits sent favorable wind and current they believed that the spirit, on occasion, decided to sweep the traveler far out to sea or draw the vessel into a watery grave.</p><p>They believed that ancient fortresses had powerful and good spirits that could fortify the strength of defenders during an attack. Famous warriors who fell during an attack on a fortress were also invoked to increase the defenders strength. Such spirits were thought to protect a certain clan and they also included a powerful warlord who fell in combat, who was invoked to ensure victory in battle, and most importantly the spirit of the clan founder. The clan founder was a matron and it was believed that she sent dreams to the incumbent clan matron to advice in time of strife.</p><p>An ancient clan fortress and giant fungi were thought to house fertility spirits. In the case of the fortress spirit it was believed to increase the fertility of sows during slushtime and croptime. They believed that Giant carnivorous fungi such as the Algark stalks contained fertility spirits because they would dispense their spores (offspring) when approached. As such the Gamorreans respected these spirits from afar.</p><p>The spirit of a murdered individual was greatly feared by most Gamorreans. They were thought to be angry at being killed by underhand means and intent on seeking revenge against the murderer. These spirits were believed to walk the land of the living during the night seeking retribution and killing all that they came across. According to the Gamorrean beliefs they were exceptionally strong and dangerous but did not possess supernatural abilities such as invulnerability or the ability to fly and could therefore be physically fought by a warrior. Since the surest way to prevent the spirit from entering the physical plane was to kill the murderer, justice was often swift on Gamorr and Pzob.</p><p>The fallen in great battles were thought to reside at the site of their demise and were believed to return during stormy winter weather to re-fight the battles. Since battles typically took place near settlements and fortresses storm damage to these dwelling were often attributed to the spirits.</p><p><b>Combat and honor</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Rog not happy, he said. Rog say, fight and kill Guth, fight and kill Ugmush, fight and kill you, then go home.\"</i></p><p>- A veteran warns Callista Ming</p></blockquote><p>Gamorrean combat was almost entirely hand-to-hand with or without a melee weapons and typically relied on physical power. Clans in regular contact with offworlders did not consider vibroblades as magical objects as they did for a long time and their increase in cutting power was considered a sign that they were a superior weapon. Vibro-axes were popular weapons among the Gamorreans and two examples were the Arg'garok and the Clan Groogrun vibro-ax. The latter was built on Gamorr by members of the Groogrun clan such as the master weapon maker Snogrutt. Another commonly used weapon was the Thogk, a traditional Gamorrean club that literally translated as \"log with a spike in it\". They were crafted with pride by pounding a metal spike through a long chunk of gorgt wood. Gamorreans also frequently wore armor called M'uhk'gfa. Traditionally each suit of battle plate was constructed from fragments of metals collected as trophies on a battlefield and bound by leather straps. A segmented collar protected the neck while plates surrounded the torso and shoulders. Thinner plates were often attached to the arms that allowed a weapon to be freely swung. A helmet was also worn that took into account the Gamorreans horns. Since their introduction to the Republic and later the Empire, the traditional skill of constructing M'uhk'gfa battle plates diminished and many Gamorreans started to acquire pre-fabricated armor.</p><p>The Gamorreans had little interest in ranged weapons such as blasters. When Republic scouts introduced them to weapons they rejected them completely. The only way for a Gamorrean male to demonstrate his \"boarness\" was through close combat. The use of a ranged weapon against another honorable Gamorrean opponent was considered dishonorable. It was, however, acceptable to use blasters and other ranged weapons against other species and dishonored Gamorreans. Gamorrean honor was governed by a set of simple rules and mainly concerns the code of conduct for combat and warfare. Boars were born and bred to fight and if they refused to or could not, they were killed by older boars (assuming that their mother allowed them to survive childhood).</p><p>It was honorable for a boar to face an opponent in combat to first blood, defeat or death. Fair tournament fights were usually only to first blood since their purpose was to attract attention and show off not to risk life. Tournaments were also the scenes of pre-arranged death matches, often concerned with a suitor challenging a husband for the right to marry a sow.</p><p>The use of \"magic\" in combat with an honorable opponent was considered dishonorable. In addition to the use of blasters, it also included any other advanced technology, the Force, natural abilities considered magical and anything else that could not be comprehended. It was also dishonorable to kill an opponent stealthily. In Gamorrean society it was acceptable to challenge an opponent, fight and kill him for no reason at all but it was an unforgivable wrong to sneak up and kill while they were not looking.</p><p>Intellectual thought was moderately discouraged in Gamorrean society and although some used intelligence and strategic planning to win battles, it was generally frowned upon. Sows were generally more intelligent than boars but it was still not socially acceptable for a sow to be overtly intelligent.</p><p>Sows did not commonly fight in pitched battles although they did fight in single combat against raiders and occasionally in duels to settle vendettas. Sows gained honor in Gamorrean society by being gweek, a term that translated as being matronly protective, having many children and tuskers, owning land and property and managing it well.</p><p>Regarding working with non-Gamorreans, they also stated they'd only work alongside them should their opponent best them in single combat, as otherwise they prefer death to servitude. This was how the first of the Gamorrean guards were recruited under the payroll of Jabba the Hutt, as well as how Thok was recruited by Arden Lyn.</p><p>Most Gamorreans had a hatred of droids and other mechanical devices and they would often needlessly destroy a droid if given the opportunity.</p><p><u>Personal weaponry at a glance</u></p><ul><li>Arg'garok vibro-axe (mid-range)</li><li>Blaster carbine (long range)</li><li>Cleaver (short range)</li><li>Dueling knife (long range)</li><li>Power gauntlets (special)</li><li>Thogk club (short range)</li></ul><p><b>Language</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Rog will not understand this. Who would write Guth's name but Guth? Rog will avenge his brother.\"</i></p><p>- Kufbrug struggles to comprehend a forged Gamorrese rune.</p></blockquote><p>Gamorreans spoke their native language of Gamorrese, or Gamorrean. To an individual unfamiliar with the language it sounded like a string of grunts, squeals and oinks. It was, however, a complex form of communication well-suited to the lifestyle of the Gamorreans. Although Gamorrese did not have a sophisticated written language it did have a very basic runic alphabet which was used for record keeping, accounting, recording epic stories, and genealogy. Gamorrean genealogy was an extremely complex subject and was studied by a small class of scholar-lawyer sows who were known to memorize genealogical listings, heroic deeds and property transactions. The runic alphabet was only typically used by educated sows although a fair number of boars could read them slowly. There were known to be several variations of the runic alphabet. Since most Gamorreans encountered in the galaxy were males, it was generally considered that the Gamorreans had no written language.<br /></p><p>Gamorrean names were simple and were generally a guttural word that the individual made up describing what they would do if somebody made them angry. Most other species did not understand the nuances of their names and therefore did not comprehend the meaning intended. Despite this, the Gamorreans continued the practice, perhaps unaware that it was generally their size and demeanor that frightened smaller opponents and not the sound of their name.<br /></p><p><b>Music</b><br /></p><p>The Gamorreans developed a unique music genre called Gamorrean opera, composed of loud grunts, snorts and growls. Another form of music invented by the Gamorreans was called Baka rock.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">History</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"How did the Empire capture Gamorr without firing a cannon bolt? They landed backwards, and the Gamorreans thought they were retreating!\"</i></p><p>- Jacen Solo</p></blockquote><p>When the first offworld traders landed on Gamorr, five Gamorrean clans fought for the right to approach the vessel. When one clan won the right to approach after two days of battle the victorious Gamorreans walked up to the trading vessel and smashed it into pieces. Six further trading expeditions suffered the same fate before a heavily armed vessel was sent with a new aim, to take the Gamorreans as slaves. After this initial contact, the galaxy found more productive uses for the Gamorreans.</p><p>As a result of their physical characteristics and low intelligence, Gamorreans away from their home planet or colony were usually employed as mercenary fighters, guards, bounty hunters or heavy laborers. Gamorreans would generally work for anyone if the price was right and the nature of the work was to their liking. They would even accept slavery if the terms were right. A draw-back for some employers in hiring Gamorreans was their contractual requirements. They generally did not consider a contract binding if it was not sealed in blood by way of combat. Since traditionally a Gamorrean warlord would force a recruit to fight to prove his ability, they expected a prospective employer to do the same. From their perspective if an offworlder could not defeat those that they hired then they were not worth working for. Though prized as mercenaries, their strong clan allegiance and hatred for rival clans made it unwise to hire groups of Gamorrean enforcers without first inquiring about their clan backgrounds. A number of species, including Sullustans, found Gamorrean females attractive, and many found work as belly dancers.</p><p>During the Jedi Civil War, Gamorreans were known to be involved with the Exchange and to take innocent beings prisoner, keeping them as slaves, taking particular interest in Wookiees. By the time of New Sith Wars, particularly the period between 1042 BBY and 1032 BBY, large numbers of Gamorrean warriors fought alongside Sith troopers under the banner of Sith Lords such as Chagras, Odion and Daiman, participating in raids and massacres. Due to these actions Gamorreans were considered cruel and merciless monsters, and their bad reputation survived into the times of the Galactic Empire. At least one, however, was intelligent and civilized enough to be the sergeant-at-arms for the New Republic Senate.</p><p>Gamorrean sows were not as commonly sighted off Gamorr or Pzob. Notable exceptions were female traders such as Ugmush, Captain of the Zicreex, who traveled from Gamorr to nearby worlds trading goods. A Gamorrean sow also performed at the world famous Purghom Musical Performance Hall on Clak'dor VII\"[14]. A large group of sows settled on the asteroid G'aav'aar'oon and formed the religious order known as the Nuns of G'aav'aar'oon. They opened their convent as a medical facility, and took a pacifist approach to life, in contrast to the typical Gamorrean philosophy.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Gamorreans in the galaxy</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"Lord Vader, your powers are improving.

Kill him.\"</i></p><p>- Palpatine walking with Darth Vader while inspecting their workers' progress</p></blockquote><p>One notable Gamorrean was the mutant Gorc, one of Jerec's band of seven Dark Jedi who were looking for the lost Valley of the Jedi.</p><p>Numerous Hutts employed various Gamorreans throughout the ages. One of them was the intergalactic kingpin of crime, Jabba the Hutt. He was fond of hiring Gamorreans because they were so inexpensive, as well as because their thick mindedness made them immune to dirty tricks such as bribery. Twelve Gamorreans were brought to Tatooine by Han Solo and Chewbacca at the request of Jabba. In order to seal the contract the crimelord agreed to fight them all at once but only if they were blindfolded. They agreed and when they were unable to see Jabba, the Hutt ordered a group of his thugs to beat them. The nine that survived dutifully pledged themselves to the Hutt that they thought gave them a good thrashing. Of the nine surviving, two were named Gartog and Ortugg. Ortugg was the leader of the Gamorreans, who looked down upon Gartogg, the most unintelligent Gamorrean in the palace. Even his fellow Gamorreans shunned him.</p><p>Shortly after the reformation of the Republic into the Empire, a Gamorrean laborer worked on the construction of Emperor Palpatine's retreat on the planet Byss. The worker was killed by Darth Vader using the Force at the request of the Emperor\".</p><p>Gardulla the Hutt also employed Gamorreans. She had about 40 Gamorreans who served her. However, almost none of those Gamorreans survived after Jango Fett infiltrated Gardulla's Palace in 32 BBY. Wartogg was one of the many Gamorrean guards who Jabba put prices on following the capture of Longo Two-Guns. Gardulla was defeated and the Gamorreans that survived were never heard from again.</p><p>Grappa the Hutt had only one known Gamorrean employed in his service. His name was Tront who, like most of his kind, loathed droids. He ran off with his partner Sol Mon when Rebels came to Grappa's palace. Other Hutts, such as Ka'Pa, also had a few Gamorreans in their employment.</p><p>Members of the Klagg and Gakfedd clans native to Pzob were abducted by the battlemoon, the Eye of Palpatine. This vessel had been programmed to pick up stormtroopers who had been implanted onto certain Outer Rim planets but it was disabled by Geith Eris and Callista Ming whose essence remained with the vessel after the Jedi's sacrificed themselves to prevent the assassination of a group of Jedi children on Belsavis. When it was later reactivated 30 years later (12 ABY) the Eye of Palpatine set off to complete its stormtrooper recovery mission. The forty-five stormtroopers deposited on Pzob diminished in numbers over the decades that followed through continual battles with the local Klagg and Gakfedd clans. When the Eye of Palpatine finally arrived the stormtrooper squad was decimated and it took the natives of Pzob in their place. They were forcibly indoctrinated through a cerebral feed and turned into stormtroopers. They wore pieces of stormtrooper armor by cutting out the sleeves or had fastened chunks onto their arms and chests with engine tape. Some of them had stormtrooper helmets perched on the top of their heads like hats.</p><p>The music band Deeply Religious had a track on their self-titled album called \"Gamorrean Hard Case\".<br /></p><p>One of the most notable Gamorreans was Voort saBinring, nicknamed \"Piggy\", a member of Wraith Squadron. He joined in 7 ABY and was a member through the Yuuzhan Vong War. As part of Project Chubar he was biochemically altered by Binring Biomedical Product to bring his attention span and intelligence more in line with Humans. When he escaped the facility he joined the fight against the Empire.</p><p>As a Wraith, saBinring participated in the fight with Imperial Admiral Apwar Trigit and was an analyst on Han Solo's anti-Zsinj task force. He continued service with the Squadron when it was transferred to New Republic Intelligence. During the Vong invasion, he participated in efforts to repel the Vong from Borleias, as both a Wraith and a member of Twin Suns Squadron.

They had sensitive eyes that could see into the infrared range and the ability to regenerate lost limbs—albeit slowly—and were anatomically built heavier and stronger than most humanoids, including Humans. They would also periodically shed their skin. Unlike some other reptilian humanoids, such as the Barabels and the Ssi-ruuk, Trandoshans had no tails. The Trandoshans were a warlike species who allied early with the Empire, taking Wookiees as slaves. A notable Trandoshan was Bossk, who was a longtime enemy of Han Solo, Chewbacca the Wookiee, and Boba Fett, as well as the infamous slaver Pekt.</p><p>As a species, they were renowned across the galaxy for great strength. This is evidenced by several members of other species boasting physical prowess and power by having defeated a Trandoshan, either in battle or in a contest of strength.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Biology and appearance</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"You lizards need to learn that I'm a lot scarier than you are.\"</i></p><p>- RC-1138</p></blockquote><p>Trandoshans were a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin— which ranged in color from sandy brown to glossy green, which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, Trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Trandoshans could regenerate lost limbs and skin until they reached their Middle Ages— around fifty-four standard years. Each of their four limbs ended in three razor sharp claws. These were perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a Trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. Though physically powerful, they were outmatched by their rivals, the Wookiees, in unarmed combat.</p><p>Trandoshans usually wore dark clothing, although the species' attire varied. The infamous Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk was known to wear a yellow flight suit, something worn by several other members of the species. Trandoshan hunters and mercenaries sometimes wore either full body armor or a mixture of armor and cloth garb. Trandoshans also often wore warm jackets and baggy trousers. Their large, scaled feet also meant that it was impossible for them to wear any sort of baseline humanoid footwear, which could present impediment to hunting.</p><p>Trandoshans had a lifespan slightly shorter than that of most sentients in the galaxy. Considered younglings until they were eleven standard years old, Trandoshans were thought of as young adults until they reached the age of fifteen, when they became full adults. By thirty five standard years, Trandoshans were middle-aged, and those living past fifty were considered old. Any Trandoshan living over sixty years was thought to be venerable, and were greatly respected by society.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Society and culture</h3><p>Trandoshans worshiped their goddess, the Scorekeeper (a deity who exists beyond time and space), whom they would appease through acts which increased their jagannath points. This was done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-Trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many Trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prized Wookiee pelts, which consequently played a large part in earning jagannath points—capturing the pelts of rare Wookiee breeds (such as silverbacks) or particularly infamous Wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's jagganath points—effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.</p><p>The lack of dexterity in their hands led the Trandoshans to develop the X10-D draft droid to perform manual labor. These could only be owned by those Trandoshans with a certain number of jagannath points.</p><p>Like their neighbors, the Wookiees, the Trandoshans also honored life debts. The recipient of a Trandoshan life debt was referred to as a ghrakhowsk. Trandoshans were known to eat bowls of still live worms as a favorite meal. A traditional Trandoshan food was Trandoshani flatcake. They were known to have a lizard dance, of which Cradossk was familiar.</p><p>There were rare cases of Trandoshans not adhering to their millennia-old cultural traditions. One such was the mercenary and assassin Nakaron whose self-confidence caused him to disregard the Trandoshan class system, being rude and disrespectful towards the Elders of the Dosha city of Forak, this led to him being banned from that city, and subsequently more cities until he was virtually exiled from Dosha.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Weaponry</h3><p>The Trandoshan arsenal was composed of a variety of unique weaponry. For ranged weaponry, the Trandoshans designed Accelerated Charged Particle Guns which resembled various slugthrowers used throughout the galaxy. Examples of these were seen during the Clone Wars; quite common were the Accelerated Charged Particle Array Gun, the Accelerated Charged Particle Repeater Gun, LS-150 Heavy Accelerated Charged Particle Repeater Gun, and the Gatling gauntlet. When they wished to take their prey alive, Trandoshan Bounty Hunters favored the Slavemaster stun carbine. They also made use of the LJ-50 concussion rifle and Trandoshan Repeater Rifle.</p><p>Most cultures long ago abandoned the primitive sword in favor of the more lethal vibroblade. Trandoshans, however, wielded such archaic weapons as badges of honor. Both the Trandoshan Sword and the Trandoshan Double-Bladed Sword were traditionally forged using the rare ore Chalon which made them sharper and heavier than Republic blades.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">History</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"Smell Wookiee. Trandoshan hate Wookiee. Human ship. Should be no Wookiee there.\"</i></p><p>- Corrsk[src]</p></blockquote><p>The Trandoshans originated on Trandosha, also known as Dosha or Hsskor. It was in the same star system as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees. In 7000 BBY, the Trandoshans joined the Galactic Republic. During the New Sith Wars Sith troops landed on Trandosha, and the Trandoshans slaughtered many of the troopers. The Sith retaliated by invading their world and burning the homes of the Trandoshans, leading the surviving Trandoshans to save themselves from death by pledging loyalty to the Brotherhood of Darkness.</p><p>Prior to the Clone Wars, Trandoshan bandits invaded and occupied the planet of Jabiim before later moving on. At this time, Dosha was only indirectly represented in the Galactic Senate by the Wookiee Yarua, much to the Trandoshans' dismay. In response, Trandoshan terrorists attempted to assassinate Yarua in 32 BBY. In 23 BBY, a Wookiee vessel was attacked over a moon of Trandosha, resulting in a Wookiee blockade of Trandosha. Peace talks to resolve the issue were conducted 22 BBY and failed when it was revealed that the Trandoshans were pushing for Senatorial representation with Trade Federation backing. During the Clone Wars, some groups of Trandoshans involved themselves on the side of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in several engagements. One such example occurred more than one year after the onset of the Clone Wars when the Acclamator-class assault ship Prosecutor was taken over by a joint force of Trandoshan slavers and CIS battle droids. Later, the Trandoshans, with the help of CIS forces, invaded the planet of Kashyyyk to subsequently enslave the Wookiee natives. The invasion of Kashyyyk by the CIS led towards an expeditionary team of clone commandos being sent to Kashyyyk by the Galactic Republic, this act ultimately led to the Battle of Kashyyyk itself. Trandoshans also worked as mercenaries and bounty hunters during that time period. Bossk was a famous bounty hunter from the time of the Clone Wars and for decades thereafter.</p><p>At some point during the Clone Wars, a group of Trandoshans began capturing prisoners, releasing them onto the moon Wasskah, and hunting them. They captured Ahsoka Tano, Jinx, O-Mer, and Kalifa. Ahsoka managed to kill Dar, but Kalifa was killed by Garnac. Later, they brought Chewbacca to the planet, but the Wookiee proved too strong for them. He managed to contact Kashyyyk, and General Tarfful came with Wookiees to their rescue.</p><p>After the Clone Wars, the Trandoshans suggested to the Empire that they use the Wookiees as slaves. The Empire, seeing cheap labor (and possible retribution for Yoda's survival and subsequent attack on Emperor Palpatine) agreed, and hired the Trandoshans to lead slaving raids on Kashyyyk and locate runaway slaves. After the Battle of Endor, the New Republic liberated Kashyyyk, yet the Trandoshans continued the raids. In response, the New Republic placed economic sanctions on Trandosha backed by a fleet of warships. Though the Trandoshans ceased the raids, hatred between the two species continued for many years to come.</p><p>At the time of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, after Kashyyyk was blockaded, more commerce flowed through Trandosha. The Trandoshans gained greater military and economic power after this.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Force-sensitives</h3><p>It was uncommon, but not unheard of, that some Trandoshans were Force-sensitive. Because of their reputations as bounty hunters they weren't usually accepted as Jedi or even Sith; there were exceptions, however, such as the Jedi Lissarkh, a Padawan of Plo Koon, the rogue Jedi Kras'dohk, and Mrssk that fought during the New Sith Wars. Normally they would use their Force-sensitivity to their advantage as bounty hunters.</p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Saurin Subspecies</h3><p>At some time in their history, a population of Trandoshans became isolated for unknown reasons, and eventually adapted along a separate lineage and became the subspecies Saurin.</p><p>They were notably different in their physiology for featuring translucent eyes, and having adapted four-fingered hands, with longer fingers than their genetic cousins.</p><p>It is unknown if Saurins carried the Trandoshan ability to regenerate lost limbs, though they did hold the same basic traditions and beliefs, such as bounty hunting and scoring kills to appease the deity The Scorekeeper.</p><p>Saurins claimed the planet Durkteel as their homeworld.</p><p><br /></p><h3 style=\"font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif\">Trandoshans in the galaxy</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"I was told the Trandoshan were an impossible race to command, yet watch how obediently they follow a simple instruction. Kill them!\"</i></p><p>- Tagta the Hutt</p></blockquote><p>One of the most well-known Trandoshans to leave their homeworld was the infamous bounty hunter Bossk. The son of Bounty Hunters' Guild leader Cradossk, Bossk devoured his siblings when he hatched, and in his youth he became one of the most celebrated Wookiee-hunters on Dosha. Bossk then joined his father as a bounty-hunter and became a respected member of the Bounty Hunters Guild. Some time later, Bossk's ship was destroyed by human smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee sidekick Chewbacca; this encounter made Bossk desperate to claim Chewbacca's pelt.</p><p>Many years later, Bossk was one of the bounty hunters chosen by Darth Vader to hunt down and capture Han Solo. Bossk begrudgingly teamed up with Wookiee bounty hunter Chenlambec and his human sidekick, Tinian I'att, believing they had inside information on the whereabouts of the two outlaws. However, the two mercenaries led Bossk into a trap, and he was left in an Imperial prison on Lomabu III. Bossk managed to escape and to steal his ship, the Hound's Tooth, back from the two double-crossers. Several months later, Bossk teamed up with fellow hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM in an attempt to steal the carbonite-encased Solo from Fett en route to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, however the attempt failed, and Bossk's ship was left badly damaged.</p><p>Bossk fought once again with Fett after the Mandalorian's apparent death in 4 ABY. Bossk's ship was destroyed, and he returned to Mos Eisley dejected, so he was surprised when Boba Fett offered him a fortune for some old information. Bossk was responsible for the death of Corran Horn's father Hal Horn, gunning him down along with the actual target, with whom the CorSec agent was speaking. Though Horn succeeded in hunting down and arresting Bossk, Imperial officer to CorSec Kirtan Loor manipulated the justice system against Horn for personal reasons by finding that since his target was death-marked by a valid Imperial bounty and given poor Trandoshan manual dexterity, Hal Horn and the other victims were unfortunate \"collateral damage\" since the underlying act was legal. Therefore, Bossk was released. Bossk made several more high-profile captures before retiring from bounty hunting around 19 ABY.</p><p>Pekt was a dark-skinned Trandoshan slaver, known for his sadistic nature and experimental slave capture techniques. As a youth, a Wookiee slave escaped and tore Pekt's arms off; the Wookiee was executed and Pekt's arms soon grew back. In 32 BBY he helped the Trade Federation colonize Alaris Prime, although they were driven off by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, though Pekt vowed to return. Pekt's reputation as a slaver grew until he eventually worked for an assortment of gangsters, mercenaries and bounty hunters, and even the Empire. After the Imperial invasion of Kashyyyk, Pekt was selected to oversee the entire slaving operation. In 4 ABY, Pekt was pursued to a fortress by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Chewbacca. Pekt perished when the fortress was destroyed.</p><p>C. 129 BBY, the Trandoshan blacksmith Khreenk arrived to Bartyn's Landing, in Lamaredd, and set up his business, Khreenk's Smithy. He was still in charge of it one hundred years later.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Any

style=\"float:right;margin:5px;border:0px\" src=\"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Classes/berserker_01.webp\" />\n<p>A massive wookiee hunter prowls through the forest, hefting his vibroaxe. With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin. </p>\n<p>A gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. </p>\n<p>Frothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p>\n<p>These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p>\n<h2>Primal Instinct</h2>\n<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.</p>\n<p>Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>\n<h2>A Life of Danger</h2>\n<p>Not every person deemed \"berserkers\" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p>\n<p>Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p>\n<p>When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?</p>\n<p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the mercenary background.</p>"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Berserker Approaches</h1>\n<p>For berserkers, rage is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel.

They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of \"family\" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee's life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a \"honor family.\"</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated. The majority of names often have softer big sounds and more melodic tones to them. Since offworlders have trouble using wookiees' real names, they often adopt simpler nicknames to go by.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Fubbodrrl, Gurrfupayyc, Kioerrr, Lavgaeffoak, Snrowbishutchuh, Zufiaarkaykkk</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Bulabba, Bonbaegnh, Hopakleupo, Keumnebheu, Onninh, Osstatiemmyock</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","traits":{"value":"<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.IXofn4D8VTinIILF]{Ability Score Increase}.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.dNWTSjSAxawJL2bJ]{Age}.</strong></em> Wookiees reach adulthood at about 40 and can live to be 400.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.o2P4IKI81LgIUSPm]{Alignment}.</strong></em> Wookiees tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>@Compendium[sw5e.speciesfeatures.F55akHA6xoWo9Pt9]{Size}.</strong></em> Wookiees tend to tower over other species, reaching heights over 8 feet and weighing 300 pounds.

style=\"float:right;margin:5px;border:0px\" src=\"systems/sw5e/packs/Icons/Classes/engineer_01.webp\" />\n<p>Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off. </p>\n<p>Inside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety. </p>\n<p>A Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.</p>\n<p>Every machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.</p>\n<h2>Behind the Curtain</h2>\n<p>While perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.</p>\n<h2>Unflappable</h2>\n<p>It takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.</p>\n<p>While creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it. You could be a street-smart mechanic who taught yourself how to fix swoop bikes as a teenager. Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make an engineer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the scientist background.</p>"},"atFlavorText":{"value":"<h1>Engineering Disciplines</h1>\n<p>Each discipline focuses on maximizing the personal use of a certain tool.

Representing the future of galactic warfare, clones were designed to be far superior to battle droids. During the last years of the Galactic Republic, clones formed the backbone of the Republic Military that waged war against the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Clone Wars was named after the Republic's clone army, which became symbolic of the conflict that had spread throughout the galaxy after a millennium of peace.</p><p>Clone troopers were grown on the planet Kamino at the request of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, having secretly commissioned the Kaminoans to build an army for the Republic. After his death, the project was taken over by the Sith. Clones were modeled on a human template, the bounty hunter Jango Fett, although their genetic structure was modified to make them less independent and more docile than their progenitor. They were also designed to age at twice the rate of natural humans, accelerating their growth and making them ready for combat in a decade's time. As the Separatist Crisis gave way to open war, the Galactic Senate empowered Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to call the clone troopers into action, leading to their debut on the battefield of Geonosis. For three years, clones fought the Separatist droids on all fronts across the galaxy. They were loyal to their Jedi Generals and the Supreme Chancellor; though some clones questioned their service, leading to isolated cases of desertion and treason, most were proud to serve the Republic as it was the only life they had ever known.</p><p>Galactic history was forever changed by a hidden control chip implanted in every clone. Chancellor Palpatine, discovered by the Jedi to be the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, issued Order 66—calling for the annihilation of the Jedi Order. With the Jedi labeled as enemies of the state, the clones turned against their generals, slaughtering them across worlds and inside the Jedi Temple on Coruscant under the stewardship of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Sidious subsequently assumed absolute power as the self-proclaimed Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Clones initially served as Imperial stormtroopers in the New Order, but were soon replaced by human conscripts. Their armor, weapons, and training inspired generations of white-armored warriors, especially the First Order stormtroopers who were also trained from early childhood to become super-soldiers.</p><h3>History</h3><p><b>Origin</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"They are totally obedient, taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"And who was the original host?\"</i></span></p><p><i>\"A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.\"</i></p><p>- Lama Su and Obi-Wan Kenobi</p></blockquote><p>Years before the Invasion of Naboo, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas came to believe that the galaxy would soon become engulfed by war. He therefore advocated for the creation of an army to ensure the defense of the Galactic Republic, but his views were ultimately rejected by his peers and he was cast out of the Jedi High Council. Undeterred by the lack of support from the other Jedi, Sifo-Dyas secretly contacted the Kaminoans—a species of experts in cloning, native to the planet Kamino—and commissioned them to create an army of clone soldiers for the Republic without authorization from either High Council or the Galactic Senate.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Sifo-Dyas was killed by the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of the Sith, resulting in the Sith's takeover of the clone trooper project. Darth Tyranus, the apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, recruited the bounty hunter Jango Fett to become the genetic template of the clone army. Various modifications were made to the Fett genome so that the clones would grow faster and be more susceptible to following orders. Hyper-aggressive and volatile tendencies were tailored; the Kaminoans resorted to growth acceleration in order to create mature clones in half the time a human took to reach maturity. Fett's genetic structure was further modified to make the clones less independent and more docile than their template. However, the clones were also designed to be capable of creative thinking, making them far superior to battle droids according to Prime Minister Lama Su. In addition to Fett's financial compensation, the bounty hunter requested an unaltered clone for himself. As a result, the clone known as Boba Fett was created without the genetic modifications that caused the other clones to grow faster and obey orders without question. Jango became a near-mythologized figure, and clones came to view him as their father figure. However, the bounty hunter himself had no pride in the army, stating they were the cloners' creation and viewing them as livestock made to be cannon fodder.</p><p>Although the Kaminoans believed that the army was meant to serve the Republic, the Sith intended to use the clone troopers as their secret weapon against the Jedi Order. The clone army's true purpose was to exterminate the Jedi, and to that end an organic inhibitor chip was implanted into the brain of every clone trooper at the third stage of their development, of which at least one failed in clone trooper Tup, causing him to kill a Jedi beforehand. Officially, the chips were supposed to make the clones less aggressive and independent than Jango Fett. The significance of the inhibitor chip was supported by the assertion that a clone would become mentally unstable and dangerous to everyone around him if his chip was damaged or surgically removed. The chips were, in fact, created to compel the clone troopers to execute Order 66—a secret protocol that authorized the destruction of the Jedi Order.</p><p>Each clone trooper had an identifying code inserted in his left wrist. During the Clone Wars, the codes were linked to the file of every individual trooper in the Republic's military database. The files, which could be accessed by an astromech droid via the scanning of a clone's identifying code, contained the clones' designation, rank and overall service record, as well as any specialized training and the units that he was affiliated with. Most clones also shared their template's dark-brown eyes, black hair, and olive skin. While there were some genetic variations, most of these clones would ultimately remain confined to Kamino, being embarrassments or case studies.</p><p>Within a decade after Sifo-Dyas commissioned the creation of the clone army, the first two-hundred thousand units were ready with a million more underway. Around the same time, the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the clone project on Kamino and duly informed the Jedi Council. By then, the galaxy was on the verge of a civil war between the Republic and a secessionist movement that ultimately formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Since the Jedi lacked sufficient manpower to guard the entire Republic, the Senate resolved to grant emergency powers to the executive branch. As a result, the clone troopers were formally organized into the Grand Army of the Republic by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the elected leader of the Senate and public persona of Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith.</p><p><b>Clone Wars</b></p><p><u>Soldiers of the Republic</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"I have to admit that without the clones, it would have not been a victory.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"Victory? Victory you say? Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun the Clone War has.\"</i></span></p><p>- Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda</p></blockquote><p>Clone troopers were deployed into battle for the first time on the planet Geonosis, where twelve Acclamator-class assault ships supplied by Kamino were loaded with two battle armies, or 192,000 troops. Under the leadership of the Jedi, the Grand Army of the Republic forced the Separatist Droid Army into full retreat and consequently won the first battle of the Clone Wars. In the wake of the Republic victory on Geonosis, Count Dooku—the alter ego of Darth Tyranus—rallied a growing number of dissenting worlds to the Separatist cause, further dividing the Republic and forcing the clone troopers to fight the war on all fronts across the galaxy.<br /></p><p>Throughout the conflict, clone troopers continuously demonstrated extreme loyalty to the Galactic Republic, especially their Jedi Generals and the Supreme Chancellor. Yet while the clones were conditioned to be absolutely obedient, every clone developed his own unique identity. Though encouraged to identify with their cohort, the clones received no time to form friendships beyond a soldier's bond. Insufficient or rushed field care led some clone veterans to have deep, physical scars. These soldiers wore their scars with pride, and some refused rehabilitative treatment to remove them.</p><p>The distinction between each clone ranged from loyal units, such as Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody\" and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" to a minority of clones who proved to be disloyal or uncommitted to the Republic's cause, such as Clone Sergeant \"Slick.\" Regarding service as slavery, Slick betrayed the Republic by accepting bribes from the Separatists and was therefore arrested as a traitor by the Grand Army. Another clone trooper displayed aberrant behavior by deserting the Grand Army and becoming a farmer under the name \"Cut Lawquane.\" For the most part, however, the clones found pride in their purpose as soldiers, and many continued to sacrifice their lives for the Republic. The clones fought alongside the Jedi and each other, and clone troopers viewed each other as brothers. While admirable, this quality could keep them from seeing the bigger picture and make them willfully ignorant of the Republic's politics. In particular, clones tended to view their fellow soldiers as family, fallen comrades as ancestors, and new recruits as descendants. Troopers also tended to see their barracks or starships as places of work.</p><p>As the Clone Wars dragged on, the stress of combat and high casualties caused cracks and strains among the ranks of the clone soldiers. Personality quirks, once considered harmless or even essential to their mental development, began to express themselves in extreme and polarizing ways. Each unit created their own rituals, small ways to identify squad mates, those from the same company, and veterans of specific campaigns. A soldier that talked about \"cracking that crystal\" identified themselves as a veteran of Christophsis and the assault on Crystal City, while an officer calling targets \"bugs\" revealed he fought in the hives on Geonosis. While many clones respected a soldier with a different background, some felt separated by time, space, and the unique aspects of their struggle.</p><p>Though the vast majority of clones remained loyal to the Republic over the course of the three-year conflict, as time progressed a small number began to question their strict obedience. Naive new clones fresh from the clone tanks found themselves fighting alongside veterans with years of combat experience, the deaths of comrades, objectives gained and failed, and the often-ineffectual civilian Republic leadership. Consequently, some veterans developed a skepticism of Republic bureaucracy that shocked even the most cynical of rookie clones. Unlike most \"natural\" species where youth question their elders, it was the older clones of the Grand Army of the Republic who found themselves questioning their values and traditions. These clones still found comfort in the company of their brothers, but life no longer seemed as cut and dry to them.</p><p><u>Public image</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Valiant men, the clones have proven to be. Saved my life and yours they have many times. Believe in them we must.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">- Yoda</span></p></blockquote><p>Throughout the Clone Wars, clone troopers featured prominently in propaganda sponsored by both the Republic and Separatist media. Through the Commission for the Protection of the Republic, a populist organization commonly known as COMPOR, clones were portrayed as the public face of the Republic's war effort, resulting in the publication of patriotic artwork such as Unite and Support the Boys in White. The posters expressed patriotism and civic duty to the citizens of the Republic. Part of a large outreach campaign, clone troopers became the symbol of the war effort, largely replacing the Jedi of previous years. Projecting strength and unity, they reminded citizens that their sacrifices were funding peace through military might.<br /></p><p>Such messages were intended to ingrain the image of the clone trooper as brave soldiers risking all for freedom, democracy and the Republic. Although COMPOR also wanted to use the Jedi Order as a tool for propaganda, Chancellor Palpatine advised against this course of action, citing sympathy for the Jedi's reluctant acceptance of their new role during wartime. As a result, very few examples of pro-Jedi messages exist as COMPOR devoted their full attention to promoting support for the clone troopers as well as loyalty to the Republic and, in particular, Chancellor Palpatine.</p><p>By contrast, the Confederacy of Independent Systems decried the clone army as a biological abomination—an inhumane practice in which weaponized embryos were carried to artificial term and turned into disposable killing machines. The Separatist cause was, therefore, portrayed as the more \"humane\" approach due to the Confederacy's use of battle droids. As the war carried on, more Republic citizens became disillusioned with the seemingly endless conflict, allowing Separatist and anti-war propaganda to take root in the Republic's territory. Widespread discontent began to erode the clones' public image despite COMPOR's efforts; even their civilian-coined nickname \"Boys in White\" backfired as anti-war activists pointed to the fact that the clones were barely thirteen years old by the third year of the Clone Wars.</p><p><b>Order 66</b></p><p><u>Sith conspiracy</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"I like a good mystery.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"Yeah? You ever hear the one about the people engineered to kill, engineered to kill their best friends, their leaders, and they don't even know it?\"</i></span></p><p>- Jay Igno and CT-5555[src]</p></blockquote><p>Near the end of the war, Order 66 was nearly discovered by the Jedi. CT-5385 \"Tup\" was a clone trooper in the 501st Legion who became mentally unstable when his inhibitor chip malfunctioned during the Battle of Ringo Vinda, causing him to kill Jedi General Tiplar. This premature execution of Order 66 resulted in an investigation by the Republic, the Jedi, and the Kaminoans. The Sith also took an interest in the matter; Count Dooku—whom Lama Su and Nala Se knew only as \"Tyranus,\" their secret benefactor—instructed the Kaminoans to prevent the Jedi from discovering the true purpose of the inhibitor chips. Tyranus was also disturbed by the degree of individuality that the clones displayed in spite of their psychological conditioning; Nala Se believed that the Jedi were responsible for encouraging greater creative thinking in the clones. Nevertheless, she was certain that, with the exception of Tup's damaged chip, the rest of the chips would function according to their design.</p><p>During the investigation, ARC trooper CT-5555 \"Fives\" became increasingly convinced that the inhibitor chip was part of a conspiracy against the Republic and the Jedi. Against Nala Se's advice, he was allowed to plead his case to Chancellor Palpatine. However, their meeting led the ARC trooper to believe that the Chancellor was involved in the conspiracy, although he was unaware of to what extent. Jedi Master Shaak Ti witnessed Fives's attempt to assassinate the Chancellor and prevented him from succeeding. Soon after his escape from the Grand Republic Medical Facility, Fives, who was trying to warn Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex, was cornered by the clone shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard and executed by Commander CC-1010 \"Fox\", commander of the Coruscant Guard. The investigation falsely concluded that Tup's chip was infected by a rare parasite native to Ringo Vinda and Fives succumbed to madness after removing his own chip on Kamino.</p><p>Shortly before dying, Tup and Fives—both of whom had their chips removed—described Order 66 as a mission that they repeatedly experienced in their nightmares. With their deaths and the removal of any evidence that could alert the Jedi to the existence of Order 66, the Chancellor convinced the Jedi Council that the clone troopers did require their inhibitor chips. Still, Rex, who had held Fives as he died, submitted a grievance report, where he stated the inhibitor chips could have an alternate purpose. While he was not sure if he believed it and knew the report would be ignored, Rex believed he owed it to Fives to record what he had learned.</p><p>The death of Fives did not completely ensure the secrecy of Order 66, however. The Jedi Council began inquiring into the specific circumstances regarding the mysterious death of Sifo-Dyas, the founder of the clone army. Alarmed by the Jedi's interest in the matter, Darth Sidious tasked his apprentice with the responsibility of eliminating any remaining loose ends that could connect the Sith with the creation of the clones. Darth Tyranus journeyed to the planet Oba Diah and killed Minister Lom Pyke of the Pyke Syndicate, but not before the Pyke revealed to the Jedi that Tyranus and Dooku were one and the same.</p><p>The Jedi Council was disturbed by the revelation of the Sith Order's involvement in the creation of the clones. Yet in spite of their suspicions regarding the reasons the Sith would provide the Jedi with an army, the Council ultimately chose to conceal their findings from the public and the government, fearing that such a discovery would undermine public confidence in the war. Moreover, Grand Master Yoda defended the clones' integrity to his peers, believing that the Jedi could trust in their loyalty as they had saved their lives many times and had proven worthy allies.</p><p><u>Fall of the Jedi</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"How widespread is this?\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"Ahsoka, it's all of us. The entire Grand Army of the Republic has been ordered to hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.\"</i></span></p><p>- Ahsoka Tano and Clone Commander Rex discuss Order 66</p></blockquote><p>After three years of constant warfare, the Separatist forces attacked Coruscant, the Republic capital world, and managed to abduct Chancellor Palpatine in the process. The clone troopers rallied to Coruscant's defense while the Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker rescued the Chancellor. During the battle, Darth Tyranus was slain by Skywalker—an act which brought the Clone Wars closer to a successful conclusion for the Republic. The Jedi Council moved to capitalize on the momentum gained by Tyranus' death in the hope of ending the war.</p><p>The Grand Army continued to fight the war on various worlds across the galaxy, including Mygeeto, Felucia, Cato Neimoidia, and Saleucami. New fronts were opened as clone troopers were deployed to Kashyyyk and Utapau; and other planets as part of the Outer Rim Sieges. CC-1004 \"Gree\" and the 41st Elite Corps fought side-by-side with the Wookiees in the Battle of Kashyyyk, under the command of Yoda, while Kenobi and Cody oversaw the Battle of Utapau between the 212th Attack Battalion and General Grievous's droid army.</p><p>As the Republic drew closer to achieving total victory in the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine revealed his true identity as Darth Sidious to the Jedi, provoking an immediate response from the Jedi Council. The consequent confrontation between the Council and the Dark Lord ended in the deaths of several Jedi Masters, including Mace Windu, and Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side of the Force. Now anointed as the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Sidious's new apprentice participated in the 501st Legion's assault on the Jedi Temple. Under the influence of Order 66, the 501st clone troopers stormed the Temple and exterminated the Jedi within. None of the Jedi were spared, including the younglings.</p><p>Around the same time, Darth Sidious issued Order 66 to the clone troopers throughout the galaxy—declaring every Jedi an enemy of the Republic. Order 66 triggered the hidden chips within the clones, compelling them to comply without question or hesitation with the plan to annihilate the Jedi. The clones turned on their unsuspecting allies and slaughtered them across numerous worlds. With the exception of a few survivors, the Jedi were all but extinct in the aftermath of the initial execution of Order 66. In addition, this protocol did not end with members of the Jedi Order, as clone troopers who failed to comply with the order were to be killed as well. Aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Skywalker's former Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and the rogue Sith Lord Maul were also targeted by the clones of the 332nd Company, who had been serving with Tano in the Siege of Mandalore. Rex, who had been promoted to be the company's Clone Commander, managed to resist his chip's control for long enough to tell Tano to find Fives. While he then fell victim to its control, Tano escaped the troopers and released Maul from captivity, intending to have him be a distraction. Tano then looked into Fives, finding Rex's grievance report on the chips. With the help of astromech droids R7-A7, CH-33P, and RG-G1, Tano had Rex knocked unconscious and brought to the medical bay, where they removed his chip, freeing him from Order 66.</p><p>After Rex informed Tano that the entire Grand Army had turned against the Jedi and their escape from the medical bay, Tano led Rex and the astromechs to the hangar to steal a shuttle. Elsewhere, Maul continued to move through the warship, ultimately entering and destroying the hyperdrive room. This pulled the Star Destroyer out of hyperspace and into the gravitational field of a moon, but the 332nd remained determined to kill Tano, even if it would result in their own deaths. Even though the clone troopers blocked their path to a Nu-class transport shuttle, Tano did not want to harm the soldiers, but Rex, who shed a tear, informed her of the troops' determination to follow Order 66. Tano was still unwilling to take their lives and devised a plan to stall the troops; while R7 prepared to drop parts of the floor, Rex distracted Clone Lieutenant/ARC trooper CT-5597 \"Jesse\" and the other clones by bringing Tano before them and explaining a complication with their order. This was that Order 66 commanded the death of the Jedi, but Tano was no longer part of their organization. Jesse rebutted, noting that Rex had told them they were under special order to kill Tano and any disobeying clone. Rex made a final plea to Jesse, but the Clone Lieutenant believed Tano was a traitor and found his superior to be in violation of protocol 66. Stating Rex would be demoted and killed with Tano, Jesse prepared the company to execute their former allies, but R7 then dropped the floor, separating a large portion of the clones and letting Tano and Rex deal with the reminder. However, Maul then entered the hangar and stole their shuttle, forcing them to look for a ship on the hangar's lower level.</p><p>The clone troopers managed to blast the three astromechs, but Tano and Rex found a functional BTL-B Y-wing fighter-bomber before the Venator entered the atmosphere. Once both were inside the Y-wing starfighter, they landed the ship nearby the Venators crash site. The clones aboard the warship, including Jesse, had been killed by the crash, but Tano and Rex buried their former comrades and used their helmets to mark each clone's grave. Tano then abandoned her lightsaber at the site. Eventually parting ways, Rex and Tano had both agreed to leave for the Outer Rim Territories.</p><p><b>Imperial service</b></p><p><u>Soldiers of the Empire</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"I heard they shut down the facilities on Kamino.

Sidious, having accumulated absolute political and military control over the Republic, was able to become the self-proclaimed Emperor of the First Galactic Empire. The Republic was no more; democracy and liberty were supplanted by the absolute rule of the Sith, leading to sweeping alterations that distinguished the New Order from the old system. During this time of change, all remaining clone troopers were re-designated as Imperial stormtroopers. As a result, the soldiers that once defended the Republic became the Empire's elite shock troops, enforcing the Emperor's will and destroying his enemies during the early days of the new Imperial Era.<br /></p><p>Despite the clones' role in the formation and enforcement of the early Empire, the clone trooper production line was halted, causing rumors to spread across the ranks with clones such as \"Ding\" and \"Kicker\" pondering the Empire's future and the fate of their kind. Knowing that the clone army had only one generation left in its future, older clones dreaded the notion of retirement and, therefore, sought ways to remain on active duty, such as joining the Emperor's Royal Guard.</p><p>The drop in casualties following the end of the war allowed the Empire to suspend clone production without a major disruption in manpower as new, non-clone recruits took up the mantle. Nevertheless, the Empire continued to make use of clones even as they were gradually phased out of service. Clone troopers were dispatched to secure Jedi sites, such as the Mid Rim Jedi way station Brighthome, a task which the clones found tedious as they preferred to serve on the battlefield. In addition, shock troopers continued to patrol the upper levels of Coruscant and even supported Darth Vader in his efforts to capture Jedi Master Jocasta Nu, the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Temple Archives.</p><p>As time passed, however, the remaining clones were deemed no longer fit for military service due to their accelerated aging process. No longer using fresh clones to replenish the army due to the shutdown of the cloning hatcheries on Kamino, the Empire introduced birth-born human recruits and conscripts into the stormtrooper ranks, thereby causing the Imperial Military to transition from a clone army to a volunteer force. In 14 BBY, Sergeant \"Crest\" was a clone trooper who still served the Empire, although Darth Vader stated that the clone's aging may have been too fast for him to remain on active duty. However, Vader ultimately promoted Crest to the rank of lieutenant.</p><p>By 4 BBY most clones had been decommissioned and were regarded as obsolete. A small number of clones remained in Imperial service, acting as training instructors for the next generation of stormtroopers. One such clone was TX-828 \"Torrent\"; as one of the last clones in the Stormtrooper Corps, he was a rare sight by the time of the Battle of Yavin. At that time he was nearing the age of forty due to his accelerated growth process, with strands of gray coloring his black hair. By then the rarity of Torrent kind was such that ISB Senior Commander Alecia Beck was surprised to encounter a stormtrooper from the original Kaminoan production line.</p><p>An Imperial clone stormtrooper known as Crag remained in military service well into the Empire's reign, despite his accelerated age. Having served as a soldier since the time of the Republic, the old clone had a strong sense of duty, which he believed was maintaining order in the galaxy. However, his personality earned the ire of a fellow trooper, Sardis Ramsin, who regarded Crag as a \"relic.\" Crag was serving as a sandtrooper of Foot Patrol 7 when his team deployed to Mos Eisley on Tatooine, shortly before the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. They had been sent to capture two droids belonging to the Rebellion, C-3PO and R2-D2, but fell under the influence of a Jedi mind trick performed by an old hermit. Unbeknownst to Crag and his team, the old man with the droids was the Jedi fugitive Obi-Wan Kenobi, who used the Force to dominate the weak-minded troopers in order to move the droids into the city unopposed.</p><p><u>Life after retirement</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"What's the point of all this? I mean, why?\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"I don't know, sir. I don't think anybody knows. But I do know that someday this war is gonna end.\"</i></span></p><p><i>\"Then what? We're soldiers. What happens to us then?\"</i></p><p>- CT-7567 and CT-5555</p></blockquote><p>During the later years of the Clone Wars, many clones talked about retirement as a reward for their service, but few knew what it entailed. Indeed, the Republic planned to retire the clones, but neither the government nor the clones knew what that meant. If a soldier brought the subject up, their commander would often put an end to the idle chatter. A few forward-looking clones contemplated work in corporate security or consultation with local militaries owing to their lack of civilian job skills, and their accelerated aging process decreased the likelihood of them learning and mastering such job skills before they died. However, strong loyalties to the former Republic created a moral quandary when it came to security work, as retired clones would possibly be fighting some of their former brethren.</p><p>Before the Republic collapsed, politicians had vetted certain officers about staying in a formalized and permanent Republic military to maintain the peace. A few exceptional clones had even been approached to run for political office. Having proven their loyalty to the Republic, and with the civilian population loving military heroes, many clones would have made ideal candidates were it not for the clones' general disdain for politicking.</p><p><b>Psychological impact of Order 66</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"The kid was right. Billaba was our hero. Yours and mine.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"That traitor? No. Never!\"</i></span></p><p><i>\"Yes. She was. And Order Sixty-Six… We followed it—I followed it—as if under some kind of spell… As if I had no will of my own. No memories of the battles we had fought together. Not for one second did it occur to me to even question the Emperor's command!\"</i></p><p><i>\"Because when soldiers question orders, people die!\"</i></p><p><i>\"People died anyway! Master Billaba died at my hands! My friend, let's take one second now… Before it's too late.\"</i></p><p><i>\"You're talking like a Jedi traitor, Grey. We did what we had to do. Anything else is literally… Unthinkable.\"</i></p><p>- CC-10/994 and \"Styles\"</p></blockquote><p>Some clones felt bitter and horrified by their actions, having been traumatized by the aftereffects of Order 66. On one occasion, CC-10/994 \"Grey\" was dismayed by his own thoughtless execution of Order 66—an experience which he described as being in trance, and therefore, unable to control his actions. Captain \"Styles\" did not share his commander's concern over the moral issues of Order 66, however. In an effort to atone for his participation in the Jedi Purge, Grey sacrificed his life to save Caleb Dume, the apprentice of Jedi Master Depa Billaba whom the clone killed while under the influence of Order 66.</p><p>Sometime after the issuing of Order 66 and the removal of Rex's chip, CC-3636 \"Wolffe,\" and CC-5576-39 \"Gregor\" had their chips removed. In the years that followed the Clone Wars, Rex and the other two clone veterans lived in retirement on Seelos, where they made a home out of a modified All Terrain Tactical Enforcer. Despite the effects of their accelerated growth, the aging clones decided to oppose the Empire by joining the nascent rebellion, a movement dedicated to the restoration of the Republic that the clones once served. Regarding the clones' view of stormtroopers, Rex was generally dismissive of the humans who replaced his brethren.</p><p><b>Clones in the Rebellion</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Tell me, what's it like to be a traitor?\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"I'm no traitor. You want an answer, ask the Emperor about it.\"</i></span></p><p><i>\"Don't you feel guilty for turning your back on the Empire and joining these rebels?\"</i></p><p><i>\"These \"rebels\" are saving people's lives, which is more than the Empire's been doing across the galaxy.\"</i></p><p>- Jeken and Rex</p></blockquote><p>Although the extensive majority of clone troopers were loyal to the Empire, held in place by training and established organic programming, a few clones were able to discover how to disconnect or repel their programming. Of those few, even fewer decided to rebel against the Empire, mostly due to their increasingly old age or situations. The rebellious clones brought their combat training and experience to the various resistance groups that they joined and were also knowledgeable in Imperial strategy and military bureaucracy. Although clones active in the growing rebellion operated apart from each other, some instances saw several clones working together.<br /></p><p>At least one Jedi survivor harbored a grudge against the clones. Kanan Jarrus was traumatized by the events of Order 66, including the sudden execution of his Master, Depa Billaba by their own clone troopers, who betrayed and murdered the Jedi Master without hesitation. This experience caused him to develop a strong sense of bitterness towards the clones. After Clone Captain Rex joined the rebellion, Jarrus still possessed his grudge for a time, but Jarrus came to respect and view him as a friend after the Captain nearly sacrificed himself for Jarrus. After the mission, Jarrus went as far as to salute the clone, which surprised Rex, but he quickly returned it. After the rebellion fully formed into the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Rex continued to serve, and was eventually promoted to the rank of commander in the organization. He served in the Battle of Endor, which would prove to be a major loss for the Empire because of the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader.</p><p><b>Legacy</b></p><p><u>Galactic Empire</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"If it's a fight you want, I hope you brought a better class of soldier than those…stormtroopers.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"They serve the Empire well, and I have a great many of them.\"</i></span></p><p><i>\"You're gonna need all of 'em.\"</i></p><p>- Rex and Alexsandr Kallus</p></blockquote><p>Although the clone trooper program was decommissioned under the Empire, their service in the Clone Wars inspired a generation of birth-born humans, both throughout the conflict and the years that followed. At the time there was no army to enlist in; save for the clones' Jedi Generals, the Grand Army of the Republic was exclusively based on a single template. The Republic faithful nevertheless wanted to do their part as citizens of the thousand-year democracy; as such, they were encouraged by COMPOR propaganda to purchase war bonds or report acts of sedition to the authorities.<br /></p><p>The Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (COMPNOR) built upon the carefully engineered symbols and messages of its COMPOR predecessor to accelerate the vast military expansion as decreed by Emperor Palpatine. For all of COMPOR's efforts to mythologize the clone troopers, portraying them as gallant heroes of the Republic in a barrage of propaganda, clones remained an abstraction in the public's mind. Yet whereas the Grand Army's ranks were exclusively clone-based, the galactic populace was encouraged by COMPNOR to serve the state by doing more than purchasing bonds, reporting treason or rationing supplies. With the cloning operation on Kamino suspended, ordinary citizens volunteered for military service in the hopes of wearing the armor of the Imperial stormtrooper and becoming heroes like the clone soldiers they idolized.</p><p>By the later years of the Galactic Empire, clone troopers and the Grand Army of the Republic were virtually forgotten, becoming what some called a \"lost generation,\" despite their valiant service. By the war's end, clones had saved billions of lives across the galaxy, while their vehicles and equipment inspired new weapons such as the E-11 blaster rifle, based on the common clone weapon the DC-15, and AT-AT, based off the clone tank the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer.</p><p><u>New Republic Era<br /></u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Of course I don't believe it! A clone that knows the location of forgotten Separatist treasures? Not only is that ridiculous, but the clones are extinct!\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">- A Devaronian, in Takodana Castle</span></p></blockquote><p>The clones of Jango Fett were extinct by the time of the New Republic Era. However, at least one clone trooper was said to have sired a child before dying in the Clone Wars. Sconto, according to his mother, was the son of that clone. Unlike the clone, Sconto aged at a normal rate and was living as a merchant in Utapau's Pau City—the site of one of the final battles in the Clone Wars—about thirty years after the Battle of Yavin. Sconto was proud of his heritage and therefore harbored resentment towards the Jedi, whom he held responsible for his father's death.<br /></p><p>CT-6116 \"Kix,\" a clone trooper of the 501st Legion, was discovered by the pirate Sidon Ithano over fifty years after the end of the Clone Wars. At the time Ithano located a downed Separatist vessel and decided to raid it, assuming he would find valuable kyber crystals once belonging to Count Dooku. Instead, he found Kix, who had been frozen in stasis since the late Clone Wars, because he had discovered Order 66. The clone medic was deeply saddened when he learned about the end of the Republic and the loss of his brothers, and ultimately joined Ithano's crew due to his expertise in Clone Wars-era technology and the knowledge he possessed regarding the locations of former military locations.</p><p><u>First Order</u></p><blockquote><p><i>\"How capable are your soldiers, General?\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\"><i>\"I won't have you question my methods.\"</i></span></p><p><i>\"They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.\"</i></p><p>- Kylo Ren and Armitage Hux</p></blockquote><p>Among military circles, the clones were remembered for their effectiveness. Determined to reclaim the Imperial legacy, the First Order initiated a clandestine project that centered on conscripting human children into its forces. Trained in live-fire drills and programmed through First Order propaganda, they became the new generation of stormtroopers. As the latest iteration of one of the most distinctive symbols of military might in the galaxy, First Order stormtroopers wore stark white armor derived from that of their Imperial predecessors and the Republic clone troopers who came before them.</p><p>Though General Armitage Hux had complete confidence in his soldiers, convinced they were well trained and programmed, his rival Kylo Ren doubted their loyalty to the First Order and Supreme Leader Snoke. During the cold war with the New Republic, Ren accused Hux's stormtroopers of harboring the potential for treason after FN-2187 betrayed the First Order. The dark warrior suggested that a clone army would be more reliable, using the rogue trooper as an example of a flaw that was potentially systemic to the stormtrooper program. The general responded to Ren's criticism by assuring him that the stormtroopers were exceptionally reliable in their combat skills and allegiance to the First Order.</p><p>At the height of the First Order–Resistance war, the Sith Eternal cult readied an army of elite soldiers to support the First Order's ultimate push toward galactic conquest. Though they were named after a revived sect of the dark side, Sith troopers were the culmination of decades that the Empire spent attempting to strip individuality from its soldiers. Molding individual beings into fervently loyal extensions of the Emperor's will was a process that experienced much trial and error since the Clone Wars. Darth Sidious was dismayed to discover that clone troopers exhibited disconcerting amounts of free will despite their genetically engineered background and numerous alterations. While the Sith troopers were not clones, they underwent flash-imprinting and loyalty conditioning built upon and advanced beyond the Kaminoan procedures of earlier generations. As a result, they were far more loyal and machine-like than the First Order's trained-from-childhood stormtroopers.</p><h3>Training</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"I want you troopers to remember—we're shoulder-to-shoulder on those front lines. Brothers! And sometimes we may quarrel, but no matter what, we are united. Rule one: we fight together.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">- \"Colt\"</span></p></blockquote><p>In order to rapidly produce a large army, the clones were subscribed to an accelerated training and aging program. All clones went through painful accelerated growth before reaching maturity, all while enduring nonstop training, simulations, and testing. Letter and number identifications were assigned to the clones to remove any sense of identity, as the cloners and trainers on Kamino viewed them as pieces of a machine, and not people. Endless mental and physical drills bled into the clones' \"recreation,\" where they participated in sports and games that resembled battle situations. Any bouts of anger or rebellion were dealt with by placing clones in retraining pods, essentially isolation tanks. Throughout their time on Kamino, their engineers muttered veiled threats of \"disposal\" if the clones failed their testing. As the war progressed, the Jedi clamped down on the more egregious attitudes, but the engineers of Kamino maintained their view of the clones as merely a product.<br /></p><p>As trainees, clones held the rank of clone cadet and were organized into multiple squads for the purpose of learning cooperation and teamwork. Cadets had several kinds of instructors; younger clones were monitored by full-grown clone sergeants and bounty hunters were hired to supervise the older clones. By the time of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Shaak Ti personally oversaw the training of new generations of clone troopers. ARC troopers were also assigned to inspect the progress of future troopers. Clones deemed exceptional in comparison to the average, rank-and-file trooper, were given specialized training in order to become elite soldiers, such as clone commandos or ARC troopers.</p><p>During the war, Shaak Ti observed how some cadets such as Domino Squad struggled to complete their training. Lama Su, who regarded the Domino clones as sub-standard units, believed they were the result of the Kaminoans' need to stretch their remaining supply of Jango Fett's DNA due to the template's untimely demise on Geonosis. The prime minister also opined that a new genotype would have to be selected in order to produce more clones fit for combat.</p><p>The clones lived and trained in Tipoca City, the capital city of Kamino, throughout their time as cadets. Naturally, clones came to regard Kamino as their homeworld, just as official records did. Training and studying under the soft white lights of the clone facilities, most never saw the rain, oceans, clouds, or sky until they left for combat. Still, from the moment of their birth, the clones received encouragement from their trainers and genetic engineers to leave Kamino, and become soldiers among the stars.</p><p>At least two clone squads were given a tour of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance during the Clone Wars as part of the Clone Youth Brigade. The point of this on-site training exercise was to test the cadets' knowledge regarding the functions and layout of a Star Destroyer. It was also meant to help prepare the cadets for their future as fully trained clone troopers.</p><p>The clones who failed to complete their training were disqualified from becoming soldiers. Instead of military service, failed clones—such as 99—were given janitorial duties and menial work. The cadets who succeeded in their trials were promoted to active duty.[60] Despite technically holding the rank of clone trooper, new troopers were regarded as rookies and referred to as \"shinies\" by older, more battle-experienced clones.</p><p>Clones were taught Basic, the language of the Galactic Republic. Those who spent a lot of time stationed on a specific planet could adopt a patois of the local language. Clones tended to litter their speech with jargon and slang—such as \"clankers\" for droids—incomprehensible to a civilian or a Jedi unfamiliar with military culture.</p><p>As the war progressed, command allowed clones to pursue hobbies within limited parameters to supplement their off-duty training and improve mental health. This improved morale and recovery; however, it also gave clones insight into the \"other side\" and how the civilian population lived.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"Generation One armor always holds up.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">- Rex</span></p></blockquote><p>Phase I clone trooper armor was the first version in the clone trooper armor series. It was issued to clone troopers on Kamino prior to the Clone Wars, and was in service until it was rendered obsolete by Phase II around the time of the Battle of Mon Cala. Both versions of clone trooper armor could be modified with an array of attachments, such as jetpacks and macrobinoculars. To better monitor ground movements and coordinate attacks, all clone troopers held a tracking device within their helmets that allowed controllers on Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ships to better monitor the combat zone.<br /></p><p>At first, Phase I armor used color to distinguish clones trained for leadership roles, such as captains and commanders, from each other and the standard troopers in the Grand Army of the Republic. As the Clone Wars progressed, color gradually became used for the purpose of armor customization and unit identification. The trend was maintained during the service of Phase II armor, but was ultimately discarded by the time of the creation of stormtrooper armor after the Clone Wars. The identifying white armor of both Phases signified an honorable symbol of defense; however, the creation of the stormtrooper skewed this symbolism into one of a faceless icon of conformity.</p><p>Clone troopers were armed with the DC-15 blaster rifle and DC-15A blaster for long ranged combat,[2] as well as blaster pistols for standard-ranged combat. They also wielded several types of grenades, including Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades and thermal detonators.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Any
