Whether your PCs are idealistic revolutionaries or scoundrels whose hearts of gold are well-tarnished, there's never a shortage of places to go, people to meet, or things to do.</p>\n<h3>A galaxy to explore</h3>\n<p>Hyperdrive was invented (or re-discovered, depending on whose version of the story one believes) about twenty-five thousand years ago, and, since that time, the history of the galaxy has been one of exploration and expansion. Major hyperspace routes cross the entire galactic disc, connecting thousands of worlds into one galactic civilization. From the remote desert world of Tatooine to the shining city-planet of Coruscant, from the Core Worlds where the Empire's grip is strong to the lawless Outer Rim, a human being could visit a new planet every day and never see them all.</p>\n<p>    But huge swathes of the galaxy still remain unexplored.

Buried pirate treasure? Anything is possible!</p>\n<h3>A galaxy at war</h3>\n<p>The galaxy is currently caught in the grips of a civil war between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. About 20 years ago, Chancellor Palpatine seized control of the Republic and transformed it into the Galactic Empire, an autocratic regime where the Senate, with its representatives from every civilized world, had sharply reduced power, the ancient mystic order of the Jedi Knights was persecuted and destroyed, and a prohuman agenda was enforced, with potentially dire consequences for the galaxy's aliens.</p>\n<p>    The Rebel Alliance, also called the Alliance to Restore the Republic, fights valiantly against the Empire. Militarily weaker, the Rebels must rely on secrecy and flexibility to keep themselves safe from the Imperial forces, and they are always seeking gifted smugglers, spies, and ne'er-do-wells to assist them in their struggle against the Empire. Recently, the Empire's mighty superweapon known as the Death Star was deployed to destroy the peaceful core world of Alderaan. Shortly thereafter, the Rebels won their first major victory against the Empire at the Battle of Yav1n, where the Death Star was destroyed. The Rebel Alliance is currently enjoying a rise in confidence and sympathy, with many new recruits and even whole worlds throwing off the yoke of Imperial oppression.</p>\n<p>    For their part, the Empire makes frequent use of bounty hunters to track down and apprehend suspected Rebel agents. Their white-armored stormtroopers are a constant presence on many worlds, a reminder that despite its recent setback, the Empire remains the most powerful force in the galaxy.</p>","folder":"f546jOy32MPKZnJW","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EvBUgghPahBHWv6p":3},"flags":{}}

If the PCs choose this option, they'll have to choose one PC to make a<strong> DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</strong> If they succeed, they negotiate a good price, and Vorn asks only <strong>600 credits.</strong> If they fail, Vorn gouges them on the price, and asks <strong>750 credits.</strong></p>\n<h4>We represent Trex. He sent us to buy the part from you.</h4>\n<p>Lying to Vorn is certainly possible. If the PCs choose this option, they'll have to choose one PC to make an opposed <strong>Charisma (Deception) check vs. Vorn's Wisdom (Insight) check.</strong></p>\n<h4>Wouldn't you rather sell the part to us than Trex, because we're so likeable and he's a bad man?</h4>\n<p>Buttering up Vorn isn't very effective, but it's worth a try.

In combat, characters gain advantage on attack rolls against targets they are hidden from and disadvantage on attack rolls against targets hidden from them. There are many, many additional reasons why advantage or disadvantage may be added to an ability check, and this is a good time to learn more about it.</p>\n<p>Characters may ga<strong>in advantage</strong> for any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offering Vorn a chance to make more money.</li>\n<li>Distracting Vorn so he cannot focus on the negotiation (or the theft).</li>\n<li>Joining in on badmouthing droids.</li>\n</ul>\nIn short, any circumstantial benefit that applies on a check may offer advantage to the active character.\n<p>Characters may <strong>suffer</strong> <strong>disadvantage</strong> from any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being a droid or sticking up for droids.</li>\n<li>Offering Vorn less money.</li>\n<li>Insulting Vorn.</li>\n</ul>\nIn short, any circumstantial hindrance that applies on any check may inflict <strong>disadvantage</strong> on the active character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In all cases, the GM has final approval on whether a check has advantage or disadvantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Remember that if multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, a character doesn’t roll more than one additional d20. Moreover, if circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, a character is considered to have neither of them, and they roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, a character has neither advantage nor disadvantage.</blockquote>\n<h4>Getting Help from the R5 Unit</h4>\n<p>The RS unit, R5-K3, is afflicted with the bad attitude common to its model and hates its master Vorn Tel- Ovis. If the PCs go outside into the junkyard and talk to it, it will be happy to go inside, steal the HMRI, and bring it to them. All the PCs have to do is keep Vorn distracted (which can be as simple as engaging him in conversation, or creating a disturbance in the shop).</p>\n<h4>Stealing the Part</h4>\n<p>There are two basic strategies the PCs can use here: stealth and violence. If the PCs use stealth, then pilfering the item without Vorn noticing will require a<strong> Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check vs. Vorn's passive Perception.</strong> If the PCs choose violence, then they must begin a combat encounter against Vorn. Vorn will not be expecting a fight, and he will have <strong>disadvantage</strong> on his initiative check. His droid simply flees from combat.</p>\n<h4>What else have you got for sale?</h4>\n<p>The PCs may wish to purchase something else from Vorn. He doesn't have any weapons or armor for sale, but the PCs may purchase @Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.iiKfJsVzcY3Ro4H9]{Medpacs} or @Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.FI8V7Bpjb3fxWVlp]{Repair kits} from him for 25 credits each.

{"_id":"SohEhq98kr8kLNBU","name":"Further Adventures: GM Tips & Advice","content":"<h2>Further Adventures: GM Tips &amp; Advice</h2>\n<p>The Game Master has the hardest job at the table, since he or she is trying to manage many characters at once and keep the session moving. It can also be the most rewarding job, as the GM has a unique role in the collaborative storytelling experience, one with great creative freedom and rewards. There are a few key pieces of advice that can make the GM's job easier and ensure a better game for everyone.</p>\n<h3>Don't let the story stop for a failed check</h3>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes made by new GMs is to conceal too much information from the other players, or to make the assumption that the PCs will succeed at every task. If the villain of the story is hiding in a secret warehouse, but the PCs fail their checks to find the warehouse, then the story can grind to a halt. The simplest solution to this is just to not roll for checks that must be passed for the story to continue. Another answer is to have an alternative means of progressing the story. For example, the PCs fail to find the villain's warehouse, but he learns that they are searching for him and sends out his minions to attack the PCs. The PCs are still \"punished\" for their failure (they have a battle they could otherwise have avoided) but now they have another means to progress the story, by interrogating the villain's minions or tracking them back to their lair.</p>\n<h3>Delegate</h3>\n<p>The GM can have a lot to keep track of, especially during busy scenes like combat or a space battle. It's okay to delegate some of the responsibilities to another player at the table. For example, one player could keep track of initiative and call out the next initiative slot each time a player finishes his or her turn. It's also entirely reasonable to let the hero players keep track of their own experience points, money, and equipment. In extreme cases, an entire NPC or spaceship could be delegated to a hero player whose PC isn't involved in a given scene. This both makes the GM's job easier and keeps that hero player involved in the scene.</p>\n<h3>Say \"Yes\" and \"Yes, but\"</h3>\n<p>Roleplaying games are collaborative, improvisational storytelling experiences. It can be helpful to look at traditional improv theater for inspiration - specifically, the rule in improv of \"say 'yes'·\"\" When someone invents a fact of the scene that enhances the story or moves the plot forward, and it could just as easily be true as not, saying \"yes\" is usually the right thing to do. Usually hero players are becoming inventive because they're looking for a way forward in the plot, so working with them to build or discover that way forward keeps the story moving.</p>\n<p>    Of course, that doesn't mean that everything should always go their way all the time. Perhaps the PCs have some illegal goods they wish to sell. The smuggler player may ask if he knows any contacts who might wish to buy the goods. The answer could be \"Yes, but the last time you met he tried to kill you.\" Now the PCs have a way forward-a possible buyer-but also a complication, something to consider and deal with. Maybe they should use an intermediary or just make sure to bring their weapons in case a fight breaks out.</p>\n<p>    The dice system is very flexible and rewards this style of play in two ways. First of all, it's quite easy to allow a player's improvised idea for an action or plan to be determined by a dice roll. \"Can I shoot the stormtroopers as I fall to the street?\" \"Yes, but the attack roll will receive disadvantage because you're falling and because you only have a moment to make the shot.\" Secondly, the dice lend themselves to improvisation very well. Successes and failures can be inspiration for new complications and unexpected boons as the story moves in new directions.</p>\n<h3>Treat the other playes like allies</h3>\n<p>Remember that all the players at the table have the same goal: tell a fun story. It's okay to admit you don't have total mastery of the rules-the group can work together to resolve a rules dispute in the way that is the most fun and best for the story. It's okay to admit to being caught flat-footed by a decision the PCs make, and to ask for a break to plan out the next few scenes. And it's okay to throw the question to the table. What happens next? What's the best way to interpret that check result? The answer to the question \"Does my character know anyone in this town?\" can be \"I don't know; does he?\" Playing a roleplaying game is a collaborative project, and you're all on the same team.</p>\n<p>    Lastly, and most importantly: If everyone is having fun, you're doing it right!</p>","folder":"f546jOy32MPKZnJW","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EvBUgghPahBHWv6p":3},"flags":{}}

They probably don't have time to do so before they launch, but a deployed mechanic can do so by performing a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> as an action. Once the HMRI is installed, it takes a little while to boot up; the ship will be able to jump to light speed 6 rounds after the reactor is installed.</p>\n<p>The HMRI is not needed to take off.

The PCs have three basic choices for how to proceed.</p>\n<h3>Talk their way past the guards</h3>\n<p>To do this, the PCs will have to come up with some sort or reason for the guards to let them through, then pass a <strong>DC 10 Charisma (Deception)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Intimidation) check</strong>. If the story the PCs come up with sounds plausible, reward them with <strong>advantage </strong>on the check. If it's very unlikely, give them<strong> disadvantage</strong>.

The door is locked, but the PCs can open it by using <strong>Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)</strong> (to trigger the physical locking mechanism) or <strong>Intelligence (Technology)</strong> (to fake a valid access code). This check has a <strong>DC of 15</strong>. If the PCs fail, they must find another way in. If they succeed, they find themselves in a small conference room off the main chamber.</p>\n<h3>Fight!</h3>\n<p>The PCs can simply attack the guards and fight their way in.

You are cleared for landing. Welcome to Mos Shuuta.\" A half dozen technicians of different species work at consoles and two security droids stand near the doorway.

If they fail, Overseer Brynn tells them to leave. If they don't, the droids attack. See \"Fight!\" above.</p>\n<h3>Slice the computer and do it themselves</h3>\n<p>No one's paying attention to the PCs, so they can simply walk up to the closest computer console, gain illicit access, and release the docking clamps themselves. This is a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology)</strong> check. If they fail the check by 5 or more, a small alarm is triggered and Overseer Brynn asks them what they think they're doing. The PCs will have to think quickly to convince her that they're harmless and should be let go! See \"Convince Overseer Brynn\" above, but add <strong>disadvantage</strong> to any check. Or the PCs can just run away - no one pursues. If the PCs fail on the <strong>Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>, they will have to somehow force Overseer Brynn or one of the other spaceport technicians to disengage the clamps (see \"Convince Overseer Brynn\" above, and perhaps \"Fight!\" as well).</p>\n<h3>Fight!</h3>\n<p>Once both droids are defeated, Overseer Brynn surrenders and agrees to help the PCs.

It is sure to be crawling with stormtroopers; see @JournalEntry[VyCN2Kd8YlJSjGcw]{01-05: Imperial Stormtroopers} for stat blocks and advice. Warehouse Besh is close to the landing bay and currently unoccupied. PCs may be able to hide in warehouse Besh to spy on the Imperials.</p>\n<h3>Barracks</h3>\n<p>Two dozen of Teemo's @Actor[NarzYKfpDuAloq2G]{Gamorrean} guards dwell here. At any given time, six of them are malingering about. Should the PCs actually manage to fight or sneak inside, a careful search reveals 75cr worth of cash and a great deal of worthless garbage.</p>\n<h3>TEEMO'S PALACE</h3>\n<p>Teemo the Hutt's opulent palace is enormous and strikingly designed. It is guarded by more Gamorreans and security droids, and a large amount of servants, supplicants, and guests fill its many halls and galleries. Teemo himself is currently in residence and any attempt to reach the Hutt will certainly be thwarted by his many guards.</p>\n<h3>ELECTRO GATE</h3>\n<p>The only way off the rocky bluff of Mos Shuuta is the stone spur at its southwest corner. The spur is guarded by a normally-dormant electrogate and a group of <strong>four Gamorreans</strong>. The electrogate is currently switched on as the Gamorreans search for the PCs, and a small group of brown-robed Jawas has gathered outside the gate, insisting they be let in to trade with the settlement. Nothing can pass through the gate until it is disabled, a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check.</strong></p>\n<h3>DEWBACK STABLES</h3>\n<p>A human woman so dark she seems burned black by the suns presides over the Dewback stables. Her name is <strong>Clarelle</strong> and she has a short temper and no patience for anyone who doesn't know how to ride a Dewback. Six of the giant lizards are in residence at the moment, and Clarelle will rent them out for <strong>100cr per day each.</strong></p>\n<h3>OFFWORLD TRADER'S</h3>\n<p>Just across the alley from <strong>Vorn's Junk Shop</strong> is the <strong>Offworld Trader's</strong>, marked by a rusty old stylized rocket ship. <strong>Bengara</strong>, the male Twi'lek proprietor, specializes in fine goods from offworld, including luxurious clothing, exotic art objects, and difficult-to-find foodstuffs and spices. In short, Offworld Trader's has anything one could want, but absolutely nothing useful, and always at too high a price.</p>\n<h3>WATER TOWER</h3>\n<p>The water tower is the tallest structure in Mos Shuuta. Climbing to the top of the tower (a <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics)</strong> <strong>check</strong>) would give any character an excellent view of the entire town.</p>\n<h3>SLAGWORKS</h3>\n<p>Three @Actor[NarzYKfpDuAloq2G]{Gamorrean} overseers (using the same stat blocks as Gamorrean thugs) oversee the wretches who labor in the slagworks. The slagworks consists of several mineshafts descending into the Mos Shuuta bluff as well as a smelting facility where the ore removed from the mines is converted into a useable state. In the guard house is a small box with 3 @Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.iiKfJsVzcY3Ro4H9]{Medpacs} and a toolkit containing 2 @Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.FI8V7Bpjb3fxWVlp]{Repair kits}. It looks like these items have been placed here so that the Gamorreans can tend to the needs of the workers and the machinery, but judging from the amount of dust on them, the guards have never even touched them. About two dozen workers of various species labor in the shafts or the smelting facility at any given time.</p>\n<h3>SHANTYTOWN</h3>\n<p>A riot of ramshackle tents, huts, and hovels clinging to outcroppings of rock, the shantytown represents the (completely unsafe) dwellings of Mos Shuuta's poor population. The various \"islands\" of the shantytown are connected to Mos Shuuta proper by rickety rope bridges with planks of rusting scrap metal. Any check on one of these bridges that fails by 5 or more may result in someone falling.</p>\n<h3>WAREHOUSE AUREK</h3>\n<p>A grotesquely fat Twi'lek male named <strong>Hotho Allaran</strong> oversees the droid market at warehouse Aurek. He is assisted by a timid protocol drord designated <strong>XL-77</strong>, or <strong>\"Exel\"</strong>. Since Trex has a reputation for using droids in his bounty hunting work, Hotho is eager to meet with Trex and sell him some droids.</p>","folder":"f546jOy32MPKZnJW","sort":175000,"permission":{"default":0,"EvBUgghPahBHWv6p":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"azNVz8iJCMH9AH4e","name":"Default Battle Map Tutorial","content":"<p>This adventure includes scenes for all of the major encounters, but it's likely that a given group will need to run encounters not covered by the prepared scenes. Some of these encounters are necessitated by the adventures themselves, and some will evolve organically out of play. We have included two default scenes to help cover these impromptu encounters.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to create a quick encounter is just to take one of the two maps, either ground or space, place tokens on it, and run the battle in an open area. They each have a generic background to break up the visual monotony.</p>\n<p>The next step of complexity is to draw directly on the background with one of <strong>Foundry's</strong> drawing tools, such as the <strong>free hand</strong> or <strong>polygon tool.</strong> A slight reimagining of the first battle of a certain cinema-changing film from 1977 might look like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/efms/scenes/default%20battle%20maps/Hand%20Drawn.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"299\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">For a more complex battle map, use the tiles on the shoulder of the map. A basic tile map uses just the floor plan, with the floors defining the positive space of the halls and rooms, and the negative space of the background defining the location of the walls. In these types of maps, a token can move on the floors and through doors, but not on any of the background squares.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The only trick to remember on these types of maps is that it means logistically, all walls are at least five-feet-thick. Door tiles are paced in the five-foot dead space between two areas to break up this implied wall. For help visualizing, see the following.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Two tiles are placed on either side of a door, but a little too far away for the sake of this visual demonstration.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/efms/scenes/default%20battle%20maps/Door%201.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"341\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">When the two rooms are moved into place, they form the complete entity of the rooms, door, and walls.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/efms/scenes/default%20battle%20maps/Door%202.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A basic floorplan for a battle can be made in just a few seconds by copying tiles out of the shoulder and pasting them into the play area, then arranging them into a quick and dirty floorplan. A floorplan for that 1977 battle, with many liberties taken, might look like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"worlds/efms/scenes/default%20battle%20maps/Floor%20Plan.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"299\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"><strong>Note:</strong> It's probably best to leave the tiles in their original location on the map's shoulder. Copy and paste them onto the the map. That way, you will always have the original with its descriptive label.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">If you want to take a few extra moments, you can paste more decorative tiles onto the map to represent things like furniture, consoles, and turbolifts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">For this tutorial, we created this map in less than two minutes. It shows just how quickly you can get a battle ready for an impromptu fight:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/efms/scenes/default%20battle%20maps/Complete%20Small%20Map.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"298\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A final note for the space map: there, things work the same, with the caveat that the planets are probably too small to represent anything but distant objects. Unless they are expanded to a huge size and used as a map border, they are best utilized as background decoration, leaving the asteroids for actual terrain and hazards.</p>","folder":"WAWIsAgAiSk8iPeH","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EvBUgghPahBHWv6p":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"dawnofdefiance","system":"sw5e","coreVersion":"9.269","systemVersion":"1.6.2.2.2.2"}}}

Mos Shuuta is situated on the top of a tall, rocky bluff, with nothing but endless desert in every direction around it. As the story begins. the PCs are attempting to escape the servants of the ruler of Mos Shuuta, Teemo the Hutt. Each of the PCs is in trouble with Teemo the Hutt for one reason or another. The only way to get off the planet and escape Teemo the Hutt is to steal a ship and fly to safety. Fortunately, they'll get a chance to do exactly that, by stealing a ship called the Krayt Fang from a Trandoshan named Trex.</p>\n<p>    Hopefully, the PCs won't attempt to climb down the rocky cliff or otherwise leave Mos Shuuta without stealing a ship. If they try, explain that the cliff is very sheer and the only entrance or exit that isn't the spaceport is very heavily guarded.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Map</h2>\n<p>The adventure map is broken into several sections. The map includes the stony bluff of Mos Shuuta, the Mos Shuuta Cantina, the Command Center, and the Krayt Fang in its landing bay.</p>\n<p>The Mos Shuuta map is reproduced here for your convenience. The PCs are expected to start in the cantina, then visit the junk shop, spaceport control, and landing bay Aurek. The other locations in Mos Shuuta are briefly described on <strong>page 15</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The Adventure Structure</h2>\n<p>The adventure is presented as a series of Encounters. The encounters are numbered and presented in the order that the PCs are expected to proceed.</p>\n<p>    In between encounters, the GM may have to improvise the transitions. These transitions can be as simple as \"You all walk from the cantina to the junk shop,\" or as complex as small sub-encounters in their own right. They're also a great opportunity to mix in some of the color and variety of Star Wars.</p>\n<h2>Raising the Curtain</h2>\n<p>When everyone is ready to begin, read the following @JournalEntry[z65XfFIunmLEiD8D]{Opening Crawl} aloud to the hero players. (And if you have a Star Wars soundtrack available, go ahead and crank that up, too!)</p>\n<h2>After Reading the Opening Crawl...</h2>\n<p>Each hero now suffers <strong>2 damage</strong> to represent his or her exhaustion from running through the desert heat of Tatooine. Instruct each hero player to subtract 2 hitpoints in the appropriate place on his or her character sheet. If a character ever suffers more damage than his or her hitpoint total, the character collapses unconscious. The PCs will have opportunities to recover hitpoints in the future.</p>\n<p>The adventure has now begun!

Adventure lurks everywhere, but sometimes the PCs need help finding it.</p>\n<p>    The Krayt Fang could be full of adventure! Each item or person the PCs find when they explore the ship could be the start of a new adventure. Maybe there's a prisoner in the holding cells with a bounty on his head - but another bounty hunter is still on his trail. Maybe a strange alien device is resting in the cargo hold. When it powers up mid-flight, it deposits the ship on an uncharted world! Even something as simple as a cargo hold full of a valuable but illicit substance will make the PCs think carefully about where to take it and how to sell it without running afoul of the authorities: an adventure in its own right. For that matter, if the ship suffered any damage then getting it repaired is likely a priority.</p>\n<p>    If Trex survived (or if he was left for dead in the spaceport: Trandoshans are notoriously hard to kill), he may come after the PCs for revenge! The PCs may wonder how he keeps finding them in every port of call and have to take their ship to a specialist to find the transponder he left there, broadcasting their location. 16</p>\n<p>    Teemo the Hutt may still be hunting the PCs, and a gunship full of bounty hunters could be hot on their tails. Finding the leader of the bounty hunters and convincing him to give up the contract may be difficult, but it's certainly better than being chased forever!</p>\n<p>    The PCs may wish to return to Mos Shuuta in the future. Perhaps they wish to settle their debts to Teemo, or to take revenge and take him down. Or maybe another job takes them to Mos Shuuta, but they must keep a low profile. In any case, if the group revisits Mos Shuuta the information in this booklet will be useful to the GM.</p>","folder":"f546jOy32MPKZnJW","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EvBUgghPahBHWv6p":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"k5z6OhPf0qzPn9Cp","name":"Introduction","content":"<h1>Welcome to Mos Shuuta</h1>\n<p>This adventure takes place in Mos Shuuta, a small city on the desert world of Tatooine. Mos Shuuta is situated on the top of a tall, rocky bluff, with nothing but endless desert in every direction around it. As the story begins. the PCs are attempting to escape the servants of the ruler of Mos Shuuta, Teemo the Hutt. Each of the PCs is in trouble with Teemo the Hutt for one reason or another. The only way to get off the planet and escape Teemo the Hutt is to steal a ship and fly to safety. Fortunately, they'll get a chance to do exactly that, by stealing a ship called the Krayt Fang from a Trandoshan named Trex.</p>\n<p>    Hopefully, the PCs won't attempt to climb down the rocky cliff or otherwise leave Mos Shuuta without stealing a ship. If they try, explain that the cliff is very sheer and the only entrance or exit that isn't the spaceport is very heavily guarded.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Map</h2>\n<p>The adventure map is broken into several sections. The map includes the stony bluff of Mos Shuuta, the Mos Shuuta Cantina, the Command Center, and the Krayt Fang in its landing bay.</p>\n<p>The Mos Shuuta map is reproduced here for your convenience. The PCs are expected to start in the cantina, then visit the junk shop, spaceport control, and landing bay Aurek. The other locations in Mos Shuuta are briefly described on <strong>page 15</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The Adventure Structure</h2>\n<p>The adventure is presented as a series of Encounters. The encounters are numbered and presented in the order that the PCs are expected to proceed.</p>\n<p>    In between encounters, the GM may have to improvise the transitions. These transitions can be as simple as \"You all walk from the cantina to the junk shop,\" or as complex as small sub-encounters in their own right. They're also a great opportunity to mix in some of the color and variety of Star Wars.</p>\n<h2>Raising the Curtain</h2>\n<p>When everyone is ready to begin, read the following @JournalEntry[z65XfFIunmLEiD8D]{Opening Crawl} aloud to the hero players. (And if you have a Star Wars soundtrack available, go ahead and crank that up, too!)</p>\n<h2>After Reading the Opening Crawl...</h2>\n<p>Each hero now suffers <strong>2 damage</strong> to represent his or her exhaustion from running through the desert heat of Tatooine. Instruct each hero player to subtract 2 hitpoints in the appropriate place on his or her character sheet. If a character ever suffers more damage than his or her hitpoint total, the character collapses unconscious. The PCs will have opportunities to recover hitpoints in the future.</p>\n<p>The adventure has now begun! Proceed to @JournalEntry[yGn63yGuloJMp9Zc]{01-01: On The Run} and use the included map found on @Scene[gOt2gtFiGA1srJdr]{Cantina} to show the interior of the Cantina.</p>","folder":"f546jOy32MPKZnJW","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"EvBUgghPahBHWv6p":3},"flags":{}}

It is sure to be crawling with stormtroopers; see @JournalEntry[VyCN2Kd8YlJSjGcw]{01-05: Imperial Stormtroopers} for stat blocks and advice. Warehouse Besh is close to the landing bay and currently unoccupied. PCs may be able to hide in warehouse Besh to spy on the Imperials.</p>\n<h3>Barracks</h3>\n<p>Two dozen of Teemo's @Actor[NarzYKfpDuAloq2G]{Gamorrean} guards dwell here. At any given time, six of them are malingering about. Should the PCs actually manage to fight or sneak inside, a careful search reveals 75cr worth of cash and a great deal of worthless garbage.</p>\n<h3>TEEMO'S PALACE</h3>\n<p>Teemo the Hutt's opulent palace is enormous and strikingly designed. It is guarded by more Gamorreans and security droids, and a large amount of servants, supplicants, and guests fill its many halls and galleries. Teemo himself is currently in residence and any attempt to reach the Hutt will certainly be thwarted by his many guards.</p>\n<h3>ELECTRO GATE</h3>\n<p>The only way off the rocky bluff of Mos Shuuta is the stone spur at its southwest corner. The spur is guarded by a normally-dormant electrogate and a group of <strong>four Gamorreans</strong>. The electrogate is currently switched on as the Gamorreans search for the PCs, and a small group of brown-robed Jawas has gathered outside the gate, insisting they be let in to trade with the settlement. Nothing can pass through the gate until it is disabled, a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check.</strong></p>\n<h3>DEWBACK STABLES</h3>\n<p>A human woman so dark she seems burned black by the suns presides over the Dewback stables. Her name is <strong>Clarelle</strong> and she has a short temper and no patience for anyone who doesn't know how to ride a Dewback. Six of the giant lizards are in residence at the moment, and Clarelle will rent them out for <strong>100cr per day each.</strong></p>\n<h3>OFFWORLD TRADER'S</h3>\n<p>Just across the alley from <strong>Vorn's Junk Shop</strong> is the <strong>Offworld Trader's</strong>, marked by a rusty old stylized rocket ship. <strong>Bengara</strong>, the male Twi'lek proprietor, specializes in fine goods from offworld, including luxurious clothing, exotic art objects, and difficult-to-find foodstuffs and spices. In short, Offworld Trader's has anything one could want, but absolutely nothing useful, and always at too high a price.</p>\n<h3>WATER TOWER</h3>\n<p>The water tower is the tallest structure in Mos Shuuta. Climbing to the top of the tower (a <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics)</strong> <strong>check</strong>) would give any character an excellent view of the entire town.</p>\n<h3>SLAGWORKS</h3>\n<p>Three @Actor[NarzYKfpDuAloq2G]{Gamorrean} overseers (using the same stat blocks as Gamorrean thugs) oversee the wretches who labor in the slagworks. The slagworks consists of several mineshafts descending into the Mos Shuuta bluff as well as a smelting facility where the ore removed from the mines is converted into a useable state. In the guard house is a small box with 3 @Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.iiKfJsVzcY3Ro4H9]{Medpacs} and a toolkit containing 2 @Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.FI8V7Bpjb3fxWVlp]{Repair kits}. It looks like these items have been placed here so that the Gamorreans can tend to the needs of the workers and the machinery, but judging from the amount of dust on them, the guards have never even touched them. About two dozen workers of various species labor in the shafts or the smelting facility at any given time.</p>\n<h3>SHANTYTOWN</h3>\n<p>A riot of ramshackle tents, huts, and hovels clinging to outcroppings of rock, the shantytown represents the (completely unsafe) dwellings of Mos Shuuta's poor population. The various \"islands\" of the shantytown are connected to Mos Shuuta proper by rickety rope bridges with planks of rusting scrap metal. Any check on one of these bridges that fails by 5 or more may result in someone falling.</p>\n<h3>WAREHOUSE AUREK</h3>\n<p>A grotesquely fat Twi'lek male named <strong>Hotho Allaran</strong> oversees the droid market at warehouse Aurek. He is assisted by a timid protocol drord designated <strong>XL-77</strong>, or <strong>\"Exel\"</strong>. Since Trex has a reputation for using droids in his bounty hunting work, Hotho is eager to meet with Trex and sell him some droids.</p>","folder":"f546jOy32MPKZnJW","sort":-6250,"permission":{"default":0,"EvBUgghPahBHWv6p":3},"flags":{}}
